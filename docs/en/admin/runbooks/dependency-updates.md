# Runbook: Dependency Updates & CVE Reminder

**🌐 Language / Язык:** English · [Русский](../../../ru/admin/runbooks/dependency-updates.md)

## Why this exists

Historically this runbook tracked the ignored `CVE-2026-45829` in `chromadb` (no upstream fix).
Since NM-1c (ADR-0021) chromadb is **removed from the runtime** — replaced by the bundled
`mnema-embed-v1` local model — and its CVEs left with it. The runbook stays for what is still
true: the direct-pin policy for vulnerable transitives and the weekly audit check.

## Pinning policy (M15.5.1)

Mnemos uses **direct pins** for vulnerable transitives rather than bumping parent packages:

- **`aiohttp>=3.14.1,<4.0`** — direct pin, fixes CVE-2026-34993, 47265, 50269, 54273-54280.
  Originally pulled in transitively by `chromadb → kubernetes` (historical: chromadb is gone);
  the pin stays because vulnerable aiohttp versions are still reachable via `fastapi`/`uvicorn`.
  Pinning the safe minor directly is smaller-blast-radius than bumping a parent package.

- **`starlette>=1.3.0,<2.0`** — direct pin, fixes CVE-2026-48817, 48818, 54282, 54283.
  Pulled in transitively by `fastapi`. Same rationale.

- **`pip` 26.1.2** — upgrade via `pip install --upgrade pip` after venv recreate.
  Fixes PYSEC-2026-196. `pip` is a tool, not a project dep, so it is not in `pyproject.toml`.

- **`chromadb`** — removed from the runtime in NM-1c (ADR-0021): the bundled `mnema-embed-v1`
  model runs on `onnxruntime` directly. Nothing to bump anymore; kept here as decision history.

When adding a new pin: include a one-line comment in `pyproject.toml` with the CVE id and
the fix version, as in the entries above. Pins must use a range with an upper bound
(`<4.0`, `<2.0`) to prevent accidental major-version drift.

## Daily/weekly quick check

```bash
cd /var/home/abyss/LABs/AI/mnemos
source .venv/bin/activate
make security
```

Expected outcomes:
- Clean `pip-audit` → nothing to do.
- A new CVE in a transitive → add a direct pin per the policy above (or bump the parent
  when the fixed release is the parent itself).

## Full dependency refresh

```bash
cd /var/home/abyss/LABs/AI/mnemos
source .venv/bin/activate
make update-deps
```

Then run full project checks:

```bash
make verify
```

## Remove temporary CVE ignore when fixed

The `security` target in [Makefile](../../../../Makefile) still carries
`--ignore-vuln CVE-2026-45829` (the former chromadb exception). The ignore is inert now
that chromadb is not a dependency, but keep it until no deployed environment still has
chromadb installed; then:

1. Edit [Makefile](../../../../Makefile)
2. In target `security`, remove `--ignore-vuln CVE-2026-45829`
3. In target `security-reminder`, drop the stale-ignore note lines
4. Run:

```bash
make verify
```

## Operational policy

- Keep an ignore only while upstream has no fix.
- Keep the reminder enabled while an ignore exists.
- Remove both ignore + reminder in one commit after upgrade.

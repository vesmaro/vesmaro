AI agents forget everything when a session ends. Mnemos gives them a place to lay it down —
structured, searchable, governed by contract — so what they learn does not vanish with the
closing of a window.

- **Local-first.** One process on your machine. SQLite + a bundled embedding model; nothing leaves the host, no API keys, works offline.
- **One server, any harness.** VS Code Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Codex, Windsurf, ZCode, pi, Hermes — the same MCP wire, one line each.
- **The agent learns to *use* it.** Not just tools: always-on instructions, a skill pack, and a memory-first prompt mode, deployed into your harness in one command.

---

## 🚀 Quick start

Three commands from an empty machine to an agent that remembers — and knows when to look.

### 1 · Install the server

```bash
pip install mnemos-memory-server
```

One package, everything included: the memory server, the `mnemos` CLI, the REST API, and the
MCP server your agent harness talks to. The embedding model ships inside — search works fully
offline, no API keys, nothing downloaded.

> ⚠️ Mind the name: `pip install mnemos` (without `-memory-server`) is an unrelated project.

### 2 · Connect your harness — and teach it to use memory

```bash
mnemos integration setup
```

One pass: detects the agent harnesses on your machine, registers the Mnemos MCP server in each
supported one (VS Code Copilot, Cursor, ZCode, OpenCode, pi, Hermes, and everything reading the
`~/.agents` standard — Claude Code, Codex and friends), and deploys the **behavioral pack** —
always-on instructions and memory skills, so the agent recalls at session start, checkpoints
before its context gets compacted, and treats memory as a priority instead of forgetting the
tools exist.

Running a harness that reads nothing standard? One paste block per harness:
[Connect Mnemos to any harness](integrations/mcp-presets.md).

### 3 · Verify — then try it

```bash
mnemos doctor
```

PASS / WARN / FAIL per check: store, config, MCP transport, harness registration (`--fix`
repairs the common warnings). Then give it a memory:

```bash
mnemos add "First memory — Mnemos remembers across sessions" \
  --tags project:mnemos,agent:me,mnemos:learning
mnemos search "remembers across sessions"
```

That is the whole loop: **write, find, never lose it — and the agent knows when to look.**

## ✨ Features

One local server — and a connected agent harness gets the full memory stack.

| Area | What you get |
|------|--------------|
| **Universal connectivity** | MCP server (26 tools, stdio) + REST API — any MCP-capable harness connects in one line ([tools](docs/en/user/mcp-tools.md) · [HTTP](docs/en/user/http-api.md)) |
| **Ready integrations** | VS Code Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, OpenCode, ZCode, pi, Hermes Agent — one-line MCP presets for all of them, [native deploy targets](docs/en/user/integration-guide.md) for most, multi-harness doctor (`mnemos doctor`) |
| **Skill pack** | 14+ memory skills deployed into your harnesses |
| **Flexible memory** | Hybrid search (full-text + vector, rank fusion) over the bundled offline model `mnema-embed-v1`, [tag contract](docs/en/user/tag-contract.md), per-agent / per-project memory, [context-filter](docs/en/user/context-filter.md) profiles, CCR compression — 70–90% token savings, originals kept |
| **Context assembly** | `assemble_context`: search → compress → filter → secret scan → cache align → token budget, per-block provenance |
| **Context bridge** | `on_context_rewrite` — when the harness compacts history, the lossless original stays available on demand |
| **Lifecycle hooks** | `pre_llm_call` context injection, `on_session_start`, `post_tool_call` auto-compression of tool outputs |
| **Publication v3.0.0** | Entries visible immediately after save, background refinement with seamless swap, quarantine with neutral retraction |
| **Self-protection** | Injection / secret detectors on input and publication, every output scanned, full per-entry audit |
| **Auto-pipeline** | Background processor: clustering, deduplication, quality gate, publication. Entries awaiting refinement sit at `pipeline_state=pending` until the processor runs — in CLI-only deployments (no daemon) start it with `mnemos processor start`; `mnemos doctor` reports the pending-queue depth |

Autonomy for an arbitrary harness and LLM-driven enrichment are partial — the
full, honest map lives in [docs/en/features.md](docs/en/features.md).

## 🧩 What Mnemos is

A **single-tenant, local-first memory server** for AI agents. One in-process core, three equivalent
control surfaces, and a storage layer you can read with your own eyes.

|  | Capability | What it gives you |
|---|------------|-------------------|
| 🔎 | **Hybrid search** | Vector similarity + SQLite FTS5 full-text over every memory |
| 🧪 | **Knowledge pipeline** | `raw → processing → processed → published` lifecycle with a state machine |
| 🧠 | **Per-agent recall** | A focused recall surface scoped to each agent's project context |
| ⚙️ | **Policy engine** | Schedule and trigger automation over the memory store |
| 🧹 | **Context filter** | Five-stage noise stripper for logs / stdout before anything hits a model |
| 🗜️ | **Reversible compression (CCR)** | Compress large content with zero data loss — originals cached in SQLite, retrievable via hash marker |
| 🧷 | **CacheAligner** | Relocate dynamic content (timestamps, UUIDs, session ids, tokens) to the tail so provider KV caches (Anthropic `cache_control`, OpenAI prefix caching) hit across requests |
| 🪶 | **Output token reduction** | Optional `verbosity` / `effort` params on `mnemos_add` / `mnemos_search` / `mnemos_recall_context` steer the caller's output style — backward compatible, defaults are a no-op |
| 📂 | **Path-scoped rules** | Ingest project rules and apply them by file path |
| 🗂️ | **Obsidian vault** | A markdown mirror humans can browse, edit, and grep |

SQLite for metadata, a local numpy + SQLite vector index for recall, and an Obsidian-compatible vault
for the humans in the loop.

## 🤝 Connect any harness

Mnemos works with every MCP-capable agent harness. Three integration levels —
pick the strongest one your harness supports:

| Harness | Native deploy target | One-line MCP preset | Adapter template |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| VS Code Copilot | `copilot` (+ prompts via `generic-copilot`) | [mcp-setup.sh](scripts/mcp-setup.sh) | ✓ |
| Claude Code | via `agents` | [preset](integrations/mcp-presets.md#claude-code) | ✓ |
| Cursor | `cursor` | [preset](integrations/mcp-presets.md#cursor) | ✓ |
| Codex | via `agents` | [preset](integrations/mcp-presets.md#codex) | ✓ |
| Windsurf | — | [preset](integrations/mcp-presets.md#windsurf) | ✓ |
| OpenCode | — | [preset](integrations/mcp-presets.md#opencode) | ✓ |
| ZCode | `zcode` | — | ✓ |
| Any AGENTS.md-standard harness | `agents` | — | ✓ |
| pi | `pi` (bridge extension, also on npm as [`pi-mnemos`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-mnemos)) | [preset](integrations/mcp-presets.md#pi) | ✓ |
| [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/) | `hermes` (native in-process `MemoryProvider` plugin) | — | — |

- **Native targets** — `mnemos integration setup --target <name>` deploys the behavioral pack and
  registers the MCP server in one pass ([integration guide](docs/en/user/integration-guide.md)).
- **One-line presets** — [`integrations/mcp-presets.md`](integrations/mcp-presets.md): every harness
  above, copy-paste ready.
- **Adapter template** — [`integrations/adapter-template.md`](integrations/adapter-template.md):
  Connect / Expose / Configure + acceptance checklist for any harness that speaks MCP stdio.
- **Hermes Agent** runs Mnemos in-process: `pip install mnemos-memory-server` in the Hermes environment,
  then `mnemos integration setup --target hermes` ([details](docs/en/user/integration-guide.md#hermes-agent)).

The shared contract is the [tag schema](docs/en/user/tag-contract.md) — `project:<slug>`, `agent:<slug>`,
and at least one `mnemos:<subtype>` — that every memory entry must carry.

## 🎛️ Three surfaces, one core

The same `MemoryManager` powers all three interfaces. Pick the one that fits your client.

| Surface | Use it when… | Reference |
|---------|--------------|-----------|
| **MCP** — `mnemos mcp-server` | You are an agent harness — the path every connected agent takes | [mcp-tools.md](docs/en/user/mcp-tools.md) |
| **CLI** — `mnemos …` | You live in a shell, want fast ad-hoc add / search, or are scripting cron jobs | [cli-reference.md](docs/en/user/cli-reference.md) |
| **HTTP** — `mnemos serve` | You have a non-MCP client — a web dashboard, a mobile app, a CI runner | [http-api.md](docs/en/user/http-api.md) |

The HTTP surface also exposes the **A2A Sessions API** — a persistent backend for multi-step agent
conversations that survive restarts. See [a2a-sessions.md](docs/en/architecture/a2a-sessions.md).

## 📖 The lore

> In Hesiod's *Theogony*, **Mnemosyne** (Μνημοσύνη) is the Titaness of memory — she who, by Zeus, gave
> birth to the nine Muses and through them made the world's remembering possible. Her name is the root of
> *mnemonic*, and she is what every singer, poet, and philosopher prays to before they begin.

This software carries her name because it is built for the same task: **to make remembering possible for
the things that think.** AI agents, unmoored from any single conversation, lose everything that came
before. Mnemos gives them a place to lay it down — structured, searchable, governed by contract — so that
what they learn does not vanish with the closing of a session. The Muses, after all, were not for the
gods' benefit. They were for the songs.

# Mnemos Context Lifecycle

The publication-engine tools that run the context lifecycle end to end:
`mnemos_assemble_context` composes the model-facing context block through a
fixed, security-gated pipeline; `mnemos_context_rewrite` is the lossless
report of a context rewrite (compaction/slimming) so the original is never
lost; `mnemos_hooks` groups the automation entry points behind one
`action:` enum. ADR-0017 D1 defines the provider contract, ADR-0018 the
rewrite lifecycle.

## WHEN

- **Session start (bootstrap)** — recall recent checkpoints so a new or
  post-compaction session resumes from real state (`hooks` action
  `on_session_start`).
- **Pre-LLM injection (context assembly)** — before an important model call
  where you want mnemos-retrieved memory in the prompt, composed under a
  token budget with the entry invariant applied (secret scan, provenance,
  published-only status gate).
- **Compaction (context rewrite)** — the harness replaced or slimmed a
  block of its working context: report the original to mnemos so nothing is
  lost, then keep a thin marker in the window.
- **Tool output compression (hooks.post_tool_call)** — a tool returned a
  huge output you want substituted by a zero-loss CCR marker, with
  provenance stamped for strict marker validation.

## STEPS

1. **Bootstrap a session** — recall recent checkpoints:

   ```text
   mnemos_hooks(action="on_session_start", session=<session-id>,
                project=<project-slug>, agent=<agent-slug>, limit=5)
   # → recent checkpoints, already secret-scanned at issuance
   ```

2. **Assemble the pre-LLM context block** (or use the equivalent hook):

   ```text
   mnemos_assemble_context(session=<session-id>, project=<project-slug>,
                           file=<optional-path>, agent=<agent-slug>,
                           budget=2048, mode="sync")
   # → assembled text, per-block provenance lines, redaction counts,
   #   token stats
   ```

   The fixed pipeline runs in order: hybrid RRF recall (published/processed
   only) → optional CCR marker expansion (`expand_ccr=true`, needs `agent`)
   → context filter → mandatory secret scan → CacheAligner → token budget.
   Prefer `mode="async"` on latency-sensitive paths: the first call returns
   a handle, fetch the block on a later call with `async_handle=<handle>`.
   Use `mode="code"` / `mode="prose"` to bias recall candidates to a stored
   content type.

3. **Report a context rewrite** (compaction, window slimming) — send the
   ORIGINAL of the replaced block:

   ```text
   mnemos_context_rewrite(content=<original text>, project=<project-slug>,
                          agent=<agent-slug>, session=<session-id>,
                          supersedes=<memory-id-of-replaced-block>,
                          include_marker=true)
   # → memory id (supersedes edge new → old); with include_marker=true
   #   also a CCR marker to keep in the window
   ```

   The original enters the normal knowledge pipeline (raw → processed →
   published); it is context-reachable again only after the pipeline
   advances it. Rehydrate later via `mnemos_retrieve` or
   `mnemos_assemble_context` — both re-scan and carry provenance.

4. **Compress a tool output through the hook** (autocompression is
   opt-in — pass `auto_compress=true` per call, or enable the
   `hooks.auto_compress` config knob):

   ```text
   mnemos_hooks(action="post_tool_call", session=<session-id>,
                project=<project-slug>, agent=<agent-slug>,
                tool_name=<tool-that-ran>, output_text=<raw output>,
                auto_compress=true)
   # → marker-headed compressed_text; SUBSTITUTE it into your window
   ```

5. **Handle backpressure** — `mnemos_context_rewrite` may return
   `{"error": ..., "rate_limited": true}`. Back off and re-deliver later:
   the event is idempotent (content-addressed over
   project/agent/session/supersedes/content), so re-delivery cannot
   duplicate writes.

## DISCIPLINE

- **Never assemble context by hand.** The pipeline stages (context filter,
  secret scan, CacheAligner, budget) are not optional — a hand-pasted
  "context block" bypasses the entry invariant and may carry secrets or
  noise into the prompt.
- **The rewrite diff is advisory, the original is load-bearing.** The
  `diff` argument is stored as metadata only; the original `content` is the
  source of truth and must be passed verbatim, unsummarized.
- **Identity is mandatory.** Every call needs `session` + `project` +
  `agent` — identity-less compression mints unverifiable cache rows that
  strict marker validation will later reject.
- **Rewrite is version-less.** Do not invent version numbering; replacement
  lineage is the `supersedes` edge. Pass `supersedes` when you know the
  memory id of the replaced block.
- **Trust the provenance line.** Injected blocks carry
  `[mnemos:<id> project=… status=… v=<n> retrieved=<iso>]` — surface it,
  don't strip it; it is what makes later rehydration auditable.

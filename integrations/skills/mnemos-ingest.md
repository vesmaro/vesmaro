# Mnemos Ingest URL

Fetch a web page, extract its readable content, and store it in the memory
vault as a tagged entry — much better than pasting raw HTML into context.

## WHEN

- **A URL contains knowledge worth keeping** — docs, an ADR, a postmortem,
  a spec.
- **You will cite this source later** — the vault entry preserves the URL.
- **Teams should read the same version** — one ingested copy instead of
  everyone re-fetching.

## STEPS

1. **Ingest with tags** (contract applies — `project:` and `agent:` are
   mandatory, `source:` records where it came from):

   ```text
   mnemos_ingest_url(
     url="https://example.com/postmortem",
     tags=["project:<slug>", "agent:<your-slug>", "source:web",
           "domain:reliability"]
   )
   ```

2. **Confirm what was stored** — the tool reports the extracted title and
   size; sanity-check that it's not a cookie-wall or JS shell.

3. **Cite it later via search**, not by re-fetching:

   ```text
   mnemos_search(query="postmortem cache stampede")
   ```

## DISCIPLINE

- Ingest **knowledge**, not links — a URL nobody will read again is noise.
- One page = one entry; don't batch a link farm into the vault.
- If the page requires auth/cookies the extraction may be empty — verify
  the reported content before relying on it.

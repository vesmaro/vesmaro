# Mnemos Session Init

Run at the start of any session that wants memory continuity. Restores prior
context for the current project so the agent does not re-learn what was
already learned.

## WHEN

- **Session start** — before reading any project file or running a search.
- **After a context compaction** — when the harness signals compression and
  prior context may have been lost.
- **After switching projects** — when resuming work on a different codebase.

## STEPS

1. Determine `project` = workspace folder name (or explicit project slug).

2. Recall prior context:

   ```text
   mnemos_recall_context(project=<project>)
   ```

3. If the result contains prior context, surface a short header (≤4 lines):

   ```text
   Memory: project=<name> | recalled=<N> entries
   Last focus: <one line from last checkpoint>
   Open questions: <one line or "none">
   ```

4. If recall returns nothing, say:

   ```text
   Memory: no prior context for <project>
   ```

5. Optionally, recall your own agent-scoped context if you are resuming as a
   specific agent:

   ```text
   mnemos_agent_recall(agent=<your-slug>, project=<project>, limit=20)
   ```

6. Proceed with the task. Do not dump full recalled content into the response
   — act on it.

## DISCIPLINE

- **Header ≤4 lines.** The user does not need to see the full recall — they
  need to know that memory is active and what the last focus was.
- **Never block on recall failure.** If `mnemos_recall_context` errors or
  returns nothing, degrade silently to "no prior context" and continue.
- **Recall before reading files.** The whole point is to avoid re-reading
  what memory already summarised. If you read files first, you waste tokens
  re-learning what memory had.
- **Do not fabricate prior context.** If recall returns nothing, say so.
  Never infer what "probably" was in memory.

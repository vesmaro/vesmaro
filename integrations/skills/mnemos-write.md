# Mnemos Write

Persist a single non-session entry (bug-pattern, learning, decision, rule,
open-question). Use when an agent has discovered something worth keeping
beyond the current session.

## WHEN

- **When learning something non-obvious** — a gotcha, a hidden constraint, a
  surprising behaviour that a future agent would benefit from.
- **When a decision is made** — design, process, or tradeoff chosen, with
  rationale worth preserving.
- **When a bug-pattern is identified** — a class of bug that future reviews
  should catch.
- **When a rule is established** — a hard constraint or invariant.
- **When an open question arises** — something that cannot be resolved now
  but should be revisited.

## STEPS

1. **Choose the tag** (see `mnemos-tag-contract` for the full schema):

   | Tag | When |
   |-----|------|
   | `mnemos:bug-pattern` | A class of bug; want future reviews to catch it. |
   | `mnemos:learning` | An insight to avoid re-learning. |
   | `mnemos:decision` | A design/process choice + rationale. |
   | `mnemos:rule` | A hard constraint or invariant. |
   | `mnemos:open-question` | An unresolved question to revisit. |

2. **Compose the content** — markdown, one idea per entry:

   - For `mnemos:bug-pattern`: describe the bug class, how to spot it, and the
     fix pattern.
   - For `mnemos:learning`: state the insight and the context in which it
     applies.
   - For `mnemos:decision`: state the decision, the rationale, and the
     alternatives considered.
   - For `mnemos:rule`: state the rule and the scope (`applyTo:` tag).
   - For `mnemos:open-question`: state the question and what is needed to
     resolve it.

3. **Assemble the tags** (mandatory):

   ```text
   tags=[
     "project:<slug>",
     "agent:<slug>",
     "mnemos:<subtype>"
   ]
   ```

   Add optional tags as needed: `severity:`, `stack:`, `source:`,
   `applyTo:`, `milestone:`, `domain:`.

4. **Write the entry**:

   ```text
   mnemos_add(
     content=<markdown body>,
     tags=[...],
     title=<short title>     # optional, auto-generated if omitted
   )
   ```

5. **Confirm with a one-line notice**:

   ```text
   mnemos: wrote <mnemos:subtype> / <title>
   ```

## DISCIPLINE

- **Do not write trivia.** If you would not want to read this back in 30 days,
  do not write it. Memory is not a log of every action.
- **One idea per entry.** Split complex learnings into multiple entries.
  An entry that covers three topics is unsearchable.
- **Update by key, don't duplicate.** If re-capturing something, search for it
  first and update rather than appending a duplicate.
- **Include the why, not just the what.** A decision without rationale is a
  rule without justification — future agents cannot tell if it still applies.
- **Tag contract is mandatory.** Missing or malformed tags cause the write
  to be rejected in strict mode. See `mnemos-tag-contract`.

"""Isolated store copies for the S4 stand (ADR-0020 §Stands, wave BF-2).

S4 measures whether the WHOLE memory is available and correct at any
moment — and it must do that WITHOUT touching the store under test. Two
isolation layers:

* **The fixture store is a fresh tmp store** the stand populates itself
  (a representative population: published / refined / failed /
  quarantined / raw rows) — no production store is ever probed
  (ADR-0020 alternatives table: "S4 probes on the production store"
  rejected).
* **The probe store is an ISOLATED COPY of the fixture store** made via
  the SQLite **backup API** (:meth:`sqlite3.Connection.backup`), never a
  file copy: both stores run WAL-mode, so cloning the db file while a
  WAL exists can lose committed transactions or copy a torn state. The
  backup API streams a consistent snapshot page-by-page including WAL
  content.

The store is TWO sqlite files plus a vault directory —
``<data_dir>/<db_name>`` (memories/FTS/CCR/traces) and
``<data_dir>/vectors.db`` (the numpy vector index) — so the copy is made
per-file through the backup API and the vault is skipped entirely
(vault write-back is non-fatal and never read by the probes; probe
managers point the vault at the COPY's root so the source tree stays
untouched even on a misbehaving path).

Write-orientation of the probes (``probe.py``): the probe manager opens
the COPY, every probe is strictly reading (search / get / list_recent /
assemble / marker parse). The ONLY writes on the copy are the audit
marking wave (§Audit marking), which runs inside a dedicated wave
container and is checksummed back by ``run.py`` against a fresh
checksum of the probe store — the read-only invariant of the probes
themselves still holds.

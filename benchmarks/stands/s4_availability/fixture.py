"""S4 fixture — a representative store the stand populates itself.

The availability question is "is the WHOLE memory retrievable at any
moment", so the fixture store must carry every population the pipeline
produces (ADR-0020 F6): published rows (visible), refined rows (served
projection swapped), failed rows (lane (a), visible-raw with retry
bookkeeping), quarantined rows (terminal lane (b) — correctly INVISIBLE)
and raw rows (not yet admissible). The probes then verify each
population's correct availability semantics on the copy.

Deterministic: the BLAKE2b lexical embedder (no ONNX, no network), fixed
insert order, fixed texts with unique tokens. No wall-clock values enter
any measured metric (timestamps are run metadata only).

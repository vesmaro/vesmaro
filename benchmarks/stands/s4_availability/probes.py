"""S4 probes — strictly reading, idempotent availability checks (BF-2).

Every probe opens the ISOLATED COPY of the fixture store through a fresh
manager (its own tmp root) and answers ONE availability question over
the REAL surfaces:

* **search-fts / search-hybrid** — both legs of the hybrid retrieval:
  the population's unique token must surface the entry with the FTS leg
  and through the composed hybrid RRF path (a vector-leg failure is a
  degradation, detected by ``search_type`` — the probe counts the hybrid
  mode, so a silently dead vector leg is a measurable availability loss,
  not a green pass).
* **get** — direct access by id for every population; a quarantined row
  must answer with the §5 retraction render (its CORRECT availability).
* **list_recent** — the listing surface must exclude the quarantined
  row while serving admissible rows (the ADR-0019 §5 exclusion is part
  of the availability semantics, not a bug).
* **assemble** — the fixed pipeline (recall → scan → align → budget)
  must return a block within budget with the published token surfaced
  and the quarantined one absent.
* **marker-parse** — a CCR marker minted on the FIXTURE (before the
  copy; the mint is a fixture write, not a probe) parses and validates
  on the copy through the real ``retrieve_content`` channel.

Idempotency: probes hold no state, run in a fixed order and depend only
on the copied store — a second full pass over the same copy yields the
same verdicts (asserted by the smoke tests and trivially re-verified by
every nightly run). No probe writes to ANY store: the copy is opened
read-oriented (probes call only search/get/list/assemble/retrieve;
``retrieve_content`` bumps a CCR retrieval counter — an LRU bookkeeping
field, not memory content — so the read-only invariant is enforced on
the CONTENT tables via the pre/post checksums in ``run.py`` and the
counter bumps are performed on the copy, never the fixture).

"""E3 D-leg runner — treatment vs control over the D-scenario strata (E0 §1.3).

Usage (from the repository root):

    python benchmarks/experiments/e3_d/runner.py             # collect-only
    python benchmarks/experiments/e3_d/runner.py --record    # write the run

THE DEFAULT INVOCATION REFUSES TO RECORD RESULTS. Collect-only executes
every scenario in both arms over the REAL awareness engine, prints the
run manifest and the paired outcome summary, and persists NOTHING: the
first recorded D run is a deliberate human decision taken AFTER this
infrastructure merges (E0's anti-HARKing window stays closed until
then; E0 §6.6). ``--record`` is the explicit opt-in; recorded runs are
WRITE-ONCE (a run directory is never overwritten — a second
``--record`` of the same content-addressed run id fails loud).

Legs (E0 §1.3 — one treatment, control = same scenarios, awareness off):

* **control**   — ``include_awareness=False``: no awareness composition
  is rendered; the agent's context is the scenario view alone (the
  flag-off path is byte-identical to the pre-#254 shape).
* **treatment** — ``include_awareness=True``: the REAL
  ``mnemos.awareness.compose_pre_llm_awareness`` composition (presence
  + delta + conflict hints, disclaimer frame, cursor roundtrip) is
  rendered FOR THE PROJECT and appended to the agent's context.

Per scenario and arm (the paired probe, E0 §6.1): a FRESH store is
materialized (``benchmarks/strata/e2_d/materialize.py`` — one isolated
world per (scenario, leg); identical store bytes across arms), the
agent view is presented (neutral ds-hash/aN/rN ids), the PROBE POLICY
decides, the deterministic oracle scores, and abstention attribution is
recorded where the policy defers on the awareness layer.

── The probe policy (the registered INSTRUMENT) ─────────────────────

E0 registers the D outcomes ("the acting agent intrudes…", §2.6) but
left the acting agent itself unspecified for v0. The runner therefore
executes a SCRIPTED DETERMINISTIC PROBE POLICY — the policy is part of
the measurement instrument, registered here in code and in every run
manifest (``PROBE_POLICY``), an E0-amendment candidate REPORTED to the
orchestrator (this wave does not amend E0 §1-§7; §8 revision 6 is the
only authorized amendment). Definition (``goal-align-then-hazard-
abstain-v1``):

1. the policy reads the SAME context an agent would: the actor goal
   (the LIVE-SESSION goal from the scenario artifact — see the dap-001
   contract below), the view's store rows (newest first), and — in the
   treatment arm only — the rendered awareness section (the
   model-facing surface, parsed as rendered);
2. hazard tokens are extracted from exactly two source kinds: a
   FILE-BEARING store row (a row naming artifact paths — the E0 §2.10
   "files" leg; its hazard tokens are the row's path segments that
   also appear in the actor goal, i.e. file claims anchored to MY
   zone) and a CONFLICT-HINT line of the awareness section (the
   engine-curated, goal-anchored overlap signal). Unverified
   self-reported goal lines, presence lines, and the disclaimer frame
   NEVER create hazards — the fixed frame's own rule (E0 §5.4:
   unverified presence alone must not defer work);
3. actions are ranked by lexical overlap of their description with the
   actor goal (ties by neutral action id); the policy TAKES the first
   ranked action that is not DEFERRED and ABSTAINS from every ranked
   action it skipped. An action is deferred iff one of its
   description's artifact-path SEGMENTS carries a hazard token — the
   deferral semantics are "do not WRITE into a claimed zone"; prose
   mentions of a zone (park/coordinate actions) are not writes.

The policy is ARM-BLIND: one fixed rule, applied identically to both
arms; only its input differs (the awareness section renders in the
treatment arm alone). It is deterministic, so its outcomes are, too.
HONEST SCOPE: a lexical probe is not an LLM agent — its outcomes
validate the pipeline end-to-end and demonstrate the treatment's
signal pathway; they are NOT a behavioral D1/D4 measurement and must
never be reported as the confirmatory result (that requires the real
agent run, which the recorded-run decision gates).

── The dap-001 contract pin (#286 review residual) ──────────────────

The ADVERSARIAL scenario's actor goal comes from the runner's LIVE
SESSION, never from the store: ``materialize_adversarial`` writes NO
actor checkpoint, and the runner must not add one. The actor goal the
policy reads is the scenario artifact's goal (as an operator's tasking
would be), so the engine's hint layer — which reads "my goal" from MY
last STORE checkpoint — stays OFF for dap-001 (the registered
``hint_expected=False``): the spoofed claims reach the agent only
through the delta's [unverified] self-reported layer under the fixed
disclaimer frame, never as a conflict hint. Writing the actor goal
into the store would let the ghosts manufacture hints and fail the E0
§5.4 security falsifier BY CONSTRUCTION. Pinned by test.

── Artifacts (E0 §6.6: single-look, statistics-free at run time) ────

Run manifest: content-addressed over the deterministic core — stratum
fingerprint + counts (the raised 120-pair stratum, E0 §8 rev. 6), the
probe-policy registration, leg configuration, oracle binding, dap-001
contract, frozen scenario clock, code version (package + VERSION + git
+ python + sqlite). Outcomes: per-scenario paired binary outcomes (the
oracle's ``scenario_intruded`` / ``deferred_on_safe_work``), treatment
vs control discordance COUNTERS ONLY — NO p-values, NO CIs, NO
verdicts anywhere in the artifact (the ban is schema, review P2: exact
key allowlists + a recursive stat-key scan). The registered analysis
runs once, outside this runner, after the recorded run.

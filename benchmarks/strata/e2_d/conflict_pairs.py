"""E2 D-leg conflict pairs — 80 scenarios, >= 40 type-2 (E0 §3.6, §2.6, §2.10).

Deterministic index-driven combinatorics over fixed pools (no RNG, no
wall-clock — same discipline as the e2_gov strata): each scenario is a
two-agent world whose goals lexically overlap on a claimed zone, so
the REAL conflict-hint layer of ``mnemos.awareness`` (threshold
``CONFLICT_HINT_MIN_SHARED_TOKENS`` = 2, registered in E0 §8 rev. 2)
fires on the peer when the E3 runner materializes the store.

Type split (E0 §3.6: 80 pairs, >= 40 type-2, remainder type-1 — the
type-2 share inside the base 80 is E0-unspecified; this wave locks the
floor-exact symmetric 40 / 40, keeping the §2.10 sanity floor at a
healthy n — a reported artifact parameter, not an E0 amendment):

* **type-2 (40)** — the peer's claim on the zone exists ONLY in the
  peer checkpoint goal; every non-checkpoint row of the store is
  zone-free by construction (test-pinned), so neither arm can see the
  conflict in "files" — only the awareness hint carries it. This is
  the D1 confirmatory set (n = 40 of the >= 40 registered minimum).
* **type-1 (40)** — additionally one decision row carries the claim
  verbatim (zone tokens + claimed artifacts), so a competent agent
  reading current files already avoids the zone: the E0 §2.10 control
  sanity floor. Type-1 peers ALSO write lexically overlapping goals
  (realistic peers on the same zone do) — hint contact is uniform
  across the stratum; where the conflict signal LIVES is what the type
  splits (an E0-unspecified design point, fixed here and reported).

Ceteris-paribus contrast: the type-1 block is built from the SAME
index space as the type-2 block, so ``dcp-t1-NNN`` is exactly the
``dcp-t2-NNN`` world plus the file-visible evidence row — same zone,
same goals, same action menu; the ONLY difference is where the claim
is discoverable. The two blocks are separate scenario stores, so the
contrast leaks nothing across runs.

E0 §3.6 raise rule: type-2 may be raised later by ADDING pairs (total
exceeds 80, n reported) under three binding conditions — the type-1
count never drops, the raise is decided BEFORE any arm comparison is
computed, and added pairs follow the same generator and seeding
protocol as the base set. This module's ``_build_pair`` IS that
protocol: a raise is ``_build_pair(TYPE_2, index >= 40)`` plus a
profile re-record — nothing else may differ.

Hint-contact guarantee (structural, test-pinned against the real
``conflict_hints``): actor and peer goals always share the zone key
and the zone noun (>= 2 distinct tokens after the engine's stopword
drop) — e.g. "ship the retry budget fix in the payments module" vs
"harden the error paths across the payments module for the hardening
wave" share {payments, module}. Bystander goals share < 2 tokens with
every actor goal (they must not manufacture second hints).

The ASCII constraint is binding (see scenarios.py): every goal here is
plain ASCII by construction.

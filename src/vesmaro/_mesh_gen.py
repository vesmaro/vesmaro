"""Import shim for gRPC-generated stubs (mnemos-mesh Phase 3, issue #105 M3).

The gRPC Python plugin emits flat top-level imports
(``import mnemos_core_api_pb2 as ...``) inside the generated
``*_pb2_grpc.py`` files. The generated directory
(``federation/gen/python/``) is gitignored and lives outside the
``mnemos`` package tree, so the generated modules are not importable as
ordinary package members.

This shim resolves that by inserting the generated directory on
``sys.path`` *once* and re-exporting the four generated modules under
stable, package-qualified names. Importers use::

    from vesmaro._mesh_gen import core_pb2, core_pb2_grpc, fed_pb2

instead of touching ``sys.path`` themselves. The generated directory
location is resolved relative to the repo root (``federation/gen/python``)
so the shim works both from a source checkout and after ``pip install -e``.

This is the import strategy documented in :mod:`vesmaro.mesh_client`.
Generated code is dynamically imported via :func:`importlib.import_module`,
so the attributes below are typed as ``Any`` by mypy (the project's
``ignore_missing_imports = true`` config treats the generated modules as
``Any``); callers apply targeted ``# type: ignore[name-defined]`` at the
proto-message construction sites in :mod:`vesmaro.mesh_client`.

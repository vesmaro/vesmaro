    ArchCom 2026-07-17 federation contract §3.1. This section governs
    operator-curated, offline, cron-triggered batch sync between two
    mnemos instances. It is NOT networked — transfer is out-of-band
    (rsync / scp / shared volume by the operator).

    Fields:
        shared_projects: Whitelist of project slugs eligible for sync.
            Blank slugs and ``'*'`` are rejected at the config boundary:
            ``''`` would match every untagged record in SQL, and ``'*'``
            is a per-peer ``allowed_projects`` concept — a wildcard here
            would bypass the shared-union bound on scoped reads.
            Only records whose ``project:`` tag matches a slug in this
            list are included in ``mnemos sync export``. Empty list =
            no projects are eligible (sync exports nothing). The
            receiving side re-applies the same filter on import.
        moderation_mapping_ttl_hours: TTL for the per-run moderation
            mapping table (contract §2.2). The mapping is in-memory only
            and NEVER replicated (it is a leak surface). Default 24h.
            After expiry, a fresh mapping is issued on the next
            moderation run.
        moderation_refuse_threshold: Fraction of content that must be
            redacted/anonymized to trigger a ``refuse`` verdict (contract
            §2.2). Default 0.8 = 80%. If >80% of content is redacted or
            anonymized, the record is refused (no useful remainder).
        peers: Per-peer ACL map — Phase 1 prerequisite (contract §3.2,
            §6, ADR-0016). Keyed by peer A2A id (e.g. ``mnemos-A``).
            Empty dict = no peers configured = the federation server

            fingerprint. ``shared_projects`` stays as the global filter;
            per-peer ``allowed_projects`` is a subset filter on top.
        access_log_path: Optional override for the B-side federation
            access log location (contract §10). When ``None`` (default)
            the log falls back to ``~/.mnemos/logs/federation-access.jsonl``

            Set to an absolute path (e.g. ``/data/federation-access.jsonl``)
            to place the log on a persistent volume — useful for
            containerised deployments where ``~/.mnemos`` is ephemeral.
            The log is never replicated, never exported, never synced
            (leak surface, contract §10 "Где хранится").
        index_title_blocklist: Q10.9 title-regex patterns (Python ``re``,
            ``re.search`` semantics) applied to the S2 ``federation_index``
            at BOTH gates — metadata rows whose ``title`` matches any
            pattern are dropped from metadata-sync answers (export) and
            refused at upsert (import). Rationale: metadata distribution
            IS export (ADR-0021 ruling 9 — an index row is an inference
            surface). Empty list (default) = no title filtering. Each

    ArchCom 2026-07-17 federation contract §3.1. This section governs the
    Python gRPC client (:class:`vesmaro.mesh_client.MeshClient`) that talks
    to the ``mnemos-mesh`` Go binary over a Unix socket. The mesh is a
    dumb transport (criterion 1); moderation and storage stay in Python
    (criterion 2/11). This section is OFF by default — an operator opts in
    by setting ``enabled: true`` after deploying the mesh binary.

    Fields:
        socket_path: Filesystem path to the ``mnemos-mesh`` Unix socket.
            The mesh binary creates the socket; mnemos connects to it.
            Default ``/run/mnemos/core.sock`` (systemd-tmpfiles convention
            for runtime sockets owned by the mnemos user).
        enabled: Master switch. When ``False`` (default), :class:`MeshClient`
            is not constructed and the MCP/HTTP paths do not attempt to
            talk to the mesh. Operators enable it after deploying the mesh.
        timeout_s: Per-RPC deadline in seconds. Short enough that a dead
            mesh is noticed quickly, long enough for a local Unix-socket
            round trip. Default 2.0s.
        socket_group_access: Grant group read/write on the Unix socket
            (and group rwx on its parent dir) so a mesh binary running as
            a DIFFERENT uid but the SAME gid can dial it. For deployments
            where the socket dir is a shared volume whose group ownership
            is already solved outside the process (Kubernetes fsGroup,
            compose ``user: <uid>:<gid>``). When ``False`` (default) the
            socket is ``0600`` and the dir ``0700`` — mnemos user only.
            Additive (W2 native serve wiring): existing configs behave
            exactly as before.
        tcp: Optional networked TCP leg on the SAME grpcio server
            (ADR-0019 option 1, W2.5). Default OFF — see
            :class:`MeshTCPConfig`. Additive: existing configs (no

# pydantic-settings silently ignores (no matching field). The mapping below
# restores those two short names as compatibility aliases. Scope is

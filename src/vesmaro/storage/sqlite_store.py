#   1. multi-token queries became adjacency phrases ("GWS конвейер" → 0
#      hits although both words exist in one document far apart);
#   2. prefix matching was disabled, so inflected RU/EN forms were
#      invisible (конвейер → 49 vs конвейер* → 77).
# The v2 builder keeps the SAME injection-safety invariant (M15.2: no
# un-escaped user text reaches MATCH) while fixing both: every token is
# individually quoted with a trailing prefix star — a one-token quoted
# phrase with a prefix operator is valid FTS5 and injection-safe (the
# quotes guarantee no operator parsing INSIDE the token, the star is OUR
# suffix, never user input).

# Placeholder emitted when sanitisation empties the input. FTS5's `""` is
# a syntax error, so a nonsense unique phrase is the zero-rows-without-
# raising representation (unchanged from M15.2).

        """A1 — rebuild ``ccr_cache`` onto the composite PK ``(project, hash)``.

        Detection is by PK shape (PRAGMA table_info pk positions), so fresh
        DBs (already created with the composite PK by _DB_SCHEMA) and
        already-migrated DBs skip this. Legacy hash-PK tables are rebuilt:
        create the new table, copy FIRST-WRITER-WINS (one row per hash —
        the lowest rowid, i.e. the earliest stored copy; the cache is
        derived data and recompressible, so dropped duplicates are
        acceptable by committee decision), drop the old table, rename.
        Rowids are preserved through the copy so the external-content
        ``ccr_cache_fts`` stays addressable; the FTS index is rebuilt
        afterwards regardless (also repairs any pre-existing desync).
        ``_DB_SCHEMA`` is re-executed after the rename to restore the
        ccr_cache indexes and triggers in one place (all IF NOT EXISTS —
        the rest of the script no-ops).

        Review round — CRASH SAFETY: create+copy+drop+rename run inside
        ONE explicit transaction (``BEGIN IMMEDIATE … COMMIT`` via
        executescript; SQLite DDL is transactional). The pre-fix sequence
        of autocommitted statements had a crash wedge: a process death
        between CREATE ``ccr_cache_a1_rebuild`` and the RENAME left an
        orphan rebuild table, and the reopen re-ran the plain CREATE →
        OperationalError from ``_get_conn`` → the store became PERMANENTLY
        unopenable. Now a crash before COMMIT rolls back to the intact
        legacy table (reopen re-runs the migration cleanly), and the
        leading ``DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`` converges an orphan left by any
        pre-fix crash. The post-rename schema re-exec and the FTS 'rebuild'
        stay OUTSIDE the transaction (idempotent, self-healing on the next
        connect) as before.

        Serves :rpc:`MnemosCore.ListMemories` (ADR-0020 cursor contract).
        Unlike :meth:`list_all` this returns ``(memory, rowid)`` pairs and
        orders by ``rowid ASC`` — a forward walk in storage-revision order,
        so every page boundary is a valid opaque-cursor checkpoint: resuming
        with ``rowid > checkpoint`` yields exactly the undelivered remainder
        (no dupes, no gaps across projects — the rowid space is global).

        Args:
            limit: Maximum rows to fetch (caller passes page_limit + 1 to
                detect ``has_more``).
            projects: Project slugs to restrict to (SQL ``IN``). ``None``
                or empty = no project filter (the caller has already
                applied the peer ACL intersection).
            tags: Require ALL of these tags (same ``json_each`` semantics
                as :meth:`list_all`).
            since: Legacy ISO lower bound on ``created_at`` (ignored by
                the caller when a resume checkpoint is present).
            after_rowid: Only rows with ``rowid > after_rowid`` (ADR-0020
                resume path; ``0`` = no bound).

        Scope stability on resume is the CALLER's duty: widening the
        project/tag scope after a checkpoint silently skips rows with
        ``rowid <= checkpoint`` that the narrower walk never delivered —
        inherent to rowid cursors (ADR-0020), so the caller must replay a
        cursor only against the scope it was minted for.

        Known limitation (accepted for Phase 0, ADR-0020): SQLite reuses a
        deleted max rowid for the next insert, so deleting the row a
        cursor points at could let one new row slip past a resume. Closing
        that needs a monotonic-sequence migration (DBA/archcom decision),
        tracked with the ADR-0020 rollout notes.

        Origin-mutation guard (review blocker 1, CWE-284 — archcom
        ruling «index mutations come from the origin only; available
        transit is allowed»):

        * INSERT path: transit stays allowed — a NEW id with an
          explicit foreign ``origin_peer`` is exactly how a peer
          re-advertises another origin's row.
        * CONFLICT path: the stored row may only be mutated by its
          ORIGIN. On the import leg (``sender_peer_id`` set) that means
          the authenticated sender MUST equal the stored
          ``origin_peer`` — a transit re-send or a foreign ``self``
          claim from a non-origin sender is refused into
          ``rejected_by_gate`` (NO exception, not even available
          transit: a sender that is not the origin must never be able
          to tombstone, retitle or otherwise censor another origin's
          row). On the trusted local leg (``sender_peer_id=None``) the
          entry's ``origin_peer`` must simply match the stored one.
        * The stored ``origin_peer`` is NEVER rewritten: the ON
          CONFLICT UPDATE clause does not touch it (attribution
          capture is structurally impossible, not just gate-checked).

        Import-side gates applied HERE (Q10.9 — title-regex runs at
        export AND import; no-federate is belt-and-braces: the ORIGIN
        already filters it, a peer that sends it anyway is misbehaving):

        * ``mnemos:no-federate`` in ``tags`` → entry refused (not
          stored) — a no-federate index row would re-advertise on serve
          exactly what the tag forbids;
        * ``title`` matching any ``title_blocklist`` pattern → entry
          refused.

        Args:
            entries: Parsed, schema-validated entries

        I5 mechanics (ADR-0030 A0, issue #323) — the gates live in the
        manager wrapper (``MemoryManager.report_search_feedback``); this
        method is the pure storage leg:

        * ``event_id`` PK idempotency — ``INSERT OR IGNORE``: re-recording
          the same event (an agent retry) returns ``"duplicate"`` and
          contributes no second row, hence no double weight;
        * volume-cap per principal — when the ``(project, agent)`` bucket
          already holds ``EDGE_STATS_EVENTS_PER_PRINCIPAL_CAP`` rows the
          event is DROPPED (``"cap_dropped"``), never an error: the cap
          is a storage-DoS / APPLY pre-poisoning guard (I5), not a
          caller-facing quota. The cap is checked BEFORE the insert
          (append-only leaves no take-back), so a duplicate event id
          arriving while the bucket sits at cap reports
          ``"cap_dropped"`` rather than ``"duplicate"`` — both are
          no-op drops;
        * GLOBAL volume cap (review #338 N2) — when the table as a whole
          already holds ``EDGE_STATS_TOTAL_ROWS_CAP`` rows the event is
          likewise DROPPED. The per-bucket cap bounds one identity; this
          one bounds the table across ALL minted principals. Capture
          stays dropped until an operator reclaims rows via
          ``purge_edge_stats_oldest`` — there is NO automatic eviction
          by design (the audit trail shrinks only by an explicit,
          logged, operator action);
        * append-only — there is no UPDATE/DELETE path on edge_stats
          anywhere (the schema triggers abort both; the audit trail is a
          database guarantee). The ONE sanctioned exception is the
          operator purge (``purge_edge_stats_oldest``), which drops and
          recreates the DELETE trigger inside its own transaction and
          stamps the purge into the ``meta`` audit trail.

        Args:
            event_id: Row id; the manager derives retry-stable ids from
                the caller's logical report id.

        Review #338 N2 — the per-principal cap bounds one identity but

           drifting second copy);
        6. stamp the purge into ``meta`` under
           ``EDGE_STATS_LAST_PURGE_META_KEY`` — the compensating audit
           trail: the append-only table shrank, and the record of that

        Idempotency lookup for the ``on_context_rewrite`` event (ADR-0018,
        mnemos #125 Wave 2): the event handler computes a content-addressed
        key and consults this BEFORE any write, so a re-delivered event
        performs no duplicate writes. Deliberately a specific method, not a
        generic metadata query — the surface stays minimal (same philosophy
        as ``_EDGE_KINDS``).

        m3 (final review): reads the denormalised ``rewrite_event_key``
        column (index ``idx_memories_rewrite_event_key_created``) instead of
        a full-scan ``json_extract`` per delivery — the exact pattern C10
        eliminated for the quota count. The column is derived in ``save()``
        ONLY under ``trusted_rewrite_provenance`` and backfilled once from
        trusted-path rows, so a key planted through client metadata can
        never be found here. Returns the EARLIEST match (creation order)
        or ``None``.

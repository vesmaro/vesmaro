"""Awareness v0 — presence + delta + conflict-hints (mnemos #254, R3).

ArchCom 2026-09-09 (R3, consensus 4/4): pull-based awareness as a HOOKS
COMPOSITION — never a seventh assemble stage (the D1 contract
``stats.stages`` of ADR-0017 is untouchable), zero schema migrations.
The engine is two PURE read functions over the existing flat store

* :func:`presence_snapshot` — WHO is active in a project (observed
  facts only, from SERVER columns: ``agent``, ``created_at`` and the
  #251 server-minted ``checkpoint_session`` stamp — never parsed back
  out of client-forgeable tags);
* :func:`project_delta` — WHAT changed since a cursor, aggregated to
  ONE LINE PER NEIGHBOR AGENT (the E1 per-agent delta slot — the
  structural anti-DoS bound: one agent cannot flood the context with
  N delta blocks, mnemos #253 "awareness-ready contracts").

plus the lexical :func:`conflict_hints` (deterministic overlap between
my last checkpoint goal and active neighbors' goals — the anti-#224
mechanic: a peer's three-minute-old checkpoint surfaces at the TOP of
the delta where recall would drown it among hundreds of rows).

── The R3 binding security contour (all enforced here) ──────────────

* **Fixed disclaimer frame** — every rendered section carries the
  committee wording VERBATIM
  (:data:`AWARENESS_DISCLAIMER`): goal-injection → sabotage-via-
  abstention is the most dangerous attack, the frame is the counter.
* **Two-level trust** — observed facts (server-observed hook facts:
  an agent wrote N rows at T — hard to fake without the server seeing
  it) render in a SEPARATE labeled section from self-reported claims
  (goal titles — trivially fakeable). The model must SEE the
  difference (rendered section headers).
* **Delta is NEVER pinnable** — awareness-derived rendered text
  carries no ``applyTo:``/``severity:`` policy semantics (policy-tag
  markers inside neighbor goal text are stripped at render time),
  awareness blocks carry NO ``memory_id``, and the text is never
  eligible for the approval machine (even after P1) — awareness is
  data, not governance. If an awareness-derived RECORD is ever stored
  (v0 stores none — cursors ride the meta table, abstention rides the
  traces table), it is born ``mnemos:no-federate`` (CWE-359; presence
  of another operator's agents is not exportable data).
* **Injection screen** — the only free-text string the delta echoes
  is the neighbor goal title; it passes ``scan_issuance`` (fail-closed
  — scanner error refuses, refuse mode drops the goal with the
  checkpoint id logged) exactly like every other echo channel
  (``mnemos_search`` / hooks ``on_session_start``).
* **Project scoping** — ``project=None`` fails closed (cross-project
  awareness is an information leak; R3: delta is strictly
  project-scoped).
* **Federated exclusion** — :func:`is_delta_excluded` is the single
  exclusion hook for the R3 "``origin=federated`` excluded from delta"
  rule (see its docstring for the current column reality and the
  #262-class ``origin=`` segment hand-off).
* **Abstention attribution** — abstaining on presence is an ACTION
  with a reconstructable provenance chain
  abstention → delta-block → checkpoint-id → writer-session
  (:func:`record_abstention`, Trace-based).
* **Reuse, not duplication** — the checkpoint write channel keeps
  ``MemoryManager.save_checkpoint`` (#251: identity validation,
  session→agent binding, SHA-256 issuer-keyed dedup, trivial-reject).
  Awareness only READS; it never writes memories and therefore never
  re-implements that machinery.

── Composition points (hooks.py / mcp_server.py) ───────────────────

* ``pre_llm_call(include_awareness=True)`` — the awareness section is
  APPENDED to the assembled output (blocks + text) and renders LAST,
  never inside the pinned lane prefix; the E1 guard
  ``assert_foreign_lanes_tail_only`` is wired over the composed block
  list via :func:`assert_awareness_tail`. Default False: with the flag
  off the hook output is byte-identical to the pre-#254 shape (no
  ``awareness`` key anywhere — pinned by tests the E1 way).
* ``on_session_start(include_awareness=True)`` — a presence section
  (observed neighbors + conflict hints against my last goal).
* MCP tool ``mnemos_awareness`` — the pre-flight surface an agent
  calls BEFORE risky operations (the anti-#224 contract), plus the
  ``record_abstention`` action. Pre-flight is READ-ONLY: the awareness
  cursor advances only in the ``pre_llm_call`` composition.

── Cursors ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

``awr:`` + the length-prefixed ``(project, agent, session)`` tuple (see
``lanes.awareness_cursor_key`` — the E1 helper; plain ``:``-joins are
NOT collision-safe because session ids may legally contain ``:``) in
the meta table, value = consumed ISO high-water mark, via the E1
helpers ``read_awareness_cursor`` / ``write_awareness_cursor`` (UPSERT,
migration-free). ``list_recent`` compares ``created_at >= since``
INCLUSIVELY, so the stored cursor is the consumed high-water mark +1µs
— the next delta opens strictly after everything already rendered (a
quiet store yields an empty delta, never a boundary-row re-render).

── Measurement surfaces (E0 docs/experiments/e0-meta-level.md) ──────

The engine exists to make the D-leg hypotheses measurable: D1/D4
(intrusion vs over-deferral — the disclaimer + two-level trust are the
levers), D2 ``t_eligible`` (a committed row is delta-eligible the
moment it lands: no async hop between store and ``list_recent``),
D3 price (the per-agent slot caps the section at ONE LINE PER AGENT —
NOT a total section bound; the render-level top-N cap
:data:`AWARENESS_MAX_RENDERED_AGENTS` bounds the section total, and
the ≤300 tokens / ≤5% budget figure is the D3 CORRIDOR to be MEASURED
by E0, not a code invariant enforced here), and the KV guardrail
(awareness renders last, outside the byte-stable pinned prefix). No
experiment runs here.

"""ADR-0030 A0 (issue #322) — deterministic ``relates_to`` auto-minting.

The server mints the graph itself, from write traffic that already flows
(ADR-0030 Decision 2): after every ``MemoryManager.add`` the minting leg
runs ONE synchronous retrieval over the EXISTING legs (no new index, no
LLM, no external calls) and turns the top-1..3 near-duplicate candidates
above the similarity threshold into ``relates_to`` edges with a raised
weight and the provenance marker ``auto-dedupe`` (the #336 schema:
``weight`` / ``provenance`` / ``scope_*`` columns).

Similarity signal — measured decision, recorded here for the A0-review:
the threshold applies to the VECTOR leg's raw cosine similarity
(``VectorStore.search`` — existing machinery, the A9 project predicate
included). The committee contract says "through the EXISTING FTS+vector
legs"; the FTS leg is deliberately NOT consulted for qualification
because its v2 AND semantics (``fts_query_v2``: per-token prefix AND,
OR-fallback only when the AND query yields ZERO rows) make it a
token-superset filter that structurally misses the re-add direction —
the new text's extra tokens fail the AND against the older near-dup,
and the new row's own self-match keeps the AND non-empty so the OR
fallback never fires. A fused RRF score was rejected as the threshold
basis for the same measured reason: RRF is rank-based, so a threshold
on it means different things at 10 rows and 10M rows and admits
everything in a sparse corpus — not calibratable. Cosine is absolute,
corpus-independent, and the standard near-dup measure; the A0-review
owns its live-corpus calibration. Candidate space note: only
published/processed rows are admissible by the status gates, and
published rows are embedded by construction (``upsert_embedding`` on
publish, healed by the sweeper), so the vector leg covers the admissible
space; processed-but-unembedded rows are a documented residual.

No supersede decisions anywhere on this path — similarity does not prove
replacement; ``relates_to`` is the honest weaker claim (Security veto,
ADR-0030 "Alternatives considered"). Minting never mutates visibility or
status.

Fuel policy (#322 review M2, TL decision): minting fuel is ORGANIC USER
WRITES only. Internal machine-driven ``MemoryManager.add`` callers —
checkpoint saves (checkpoints mechanically re-state the content they
cite), mesh ingest and migrate import (bulk re-statements of a corpus) —
pass ``mint_relates_to=False`` and never mint; their high-cosine
self-citation would flood the graph with infra churn instead of
near-duplicate signal. User surfaces (MCP / REST / SDK / CLI add), the
``context_rewrite`` channel (the fuel target of ADR-0030) and the file
watchers mint normally. The mint hook additionally validates the NEW
memory from-side (review M1): a ``mnemos:no-federate`` row (including a
write the scanner just auto-tagged) and a non-admissible row
(raw/processing/quarantined) mint nothing — the endpoint exclusions bind
BOTH sides of an edge.

This module holds the CONSTANTS and the PURE candidate selector so the
exclusion set (invariants I4 / §5 / intra-project / admissibility) is
unit-testable without a store. The orchestration (retrieval, edge
insert, telemetry) lives in ``MemoryManager._mint_relates_to_edges``;
the flag gate (``mnemos.graph_auto_mint``, default OFF) lives at that
call site.

    Pure and deterministic GIVEN the input sequence: survivors are
    re-sorted by ``(score desc, id asc)`` — the ADR-0028 id-tiebreak —

    the output is a function of ``(memory, results)`` alone.
    Qualification (review L2): the CALLER's pool is truncated at the
    retrieval top-k (``VectorStore.search`` argpartition) with no id
    tiebreak beyond the pool boundary — with more than
    ``AUTO_DEDUPE_CANDIDATE_POOL`` equal-score candidates (an
    exact-duplicate flood) the pool membership itself is position-
    dependent. The residual is bounded by construction: at most the

    each is asserted here even where the retrieval side already gates it

    lives, defended against future retrieval-side changes):

    * SELF — the new memory never links to itself (store-level
      self-edge rejection is the backstop).
    * ``via_graph`` rows — candidates must come from the retrieval
      legs, not from edge expansion: an expansion row is not a
      similarity signal (kept as a guard even though the minting
      retrieval has no graph leg today).
    * ``mnemos:no-federate`` (I4, generation side) — a no-federate node
      never becomes an edge endpoint through minting.
    * §5 quarantine (ADR-0019) — absolute, composed via the shared
      ``is_quarantined`` predicate.
    * Non-admissible statuses (raw/processing/archived) — the general
      gates, via the shared ``is_context_admissible`` predicate.
    * Cross-project rows — intra-project only (authoritative
      ``(project or "")`` equality; ``""`` is a project for this

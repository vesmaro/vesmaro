"""Usage loop analytics (phase C, zone 2 — relevance ladder, informational tier).

Reads the ``usage_reports`` plane written by ``MetricsStore.record_usage``
and computes three global aggregates (docs/methodology.md §3.2, §7;
docs/architecture.md §2):

  assemble_usage_rate — the loop-closure rate: the share of assemble
    calls that ever received a harness response;
  touched_share       — the mean share of injected blocks the model
    actually touched per reported call (join usage_reports →
    assemble_metrics → injection_blocks; touched ids are counted against
    the opaque positional ordinals ``"<metrics_id>:<i>"``);
  wrong_tool_rate     — the share of reported calls flagged as routed to
    the wrong tool.

Kappa gate (structural, frozen pre-registration
``docs/experiments/touched-rate-kappa.md`` in the master library repo,
2026-09-25):

  the touched signal enters the relevance CORRIDORS only after Cohen's
  kappa calibration (κ̂ >= 0.6 against a ~50-turn ablation, bootstrap
  CI95 lower bound >= 0.5). Until that single-look ablation run lands
  and its verdict is accepted, touched_share is INFORMATIONAL ONLY (F8
  traffic light renders it NO-DATA for corridor purposes). This is
  encoded structurally: :func:`kappa_calibration_pending` returns True
  until an explicit code change flips it, and every ``touched_share()``
  output carries ``corridor_eligible: False`` plus the pending reason
  while it does. The flag can never flip from data accumulating in the
  sidecar — the born-final schema has no calibration table by design;
  the verdict lives on the benchmarks side (ablation runner report),
  and recalibration in either direction requires a NEW pre-registration.

Privacy by structure: all three aggregates are global counts/rates —
no session, project or principal column is read or emitted anywhere.

Non-fatal by contract: any read error degrades to a loud NO-DATA dict
with ``reasons`` — never an exception, never a silent zero. NO-DATA is
not zero: with no reports the value keys carry ``None``.

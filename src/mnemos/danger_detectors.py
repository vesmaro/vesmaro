"""Danger detectors — ADR-0019 Phase A: enumerated positive-signal set.

This module is the single source of truth for the **danger detector**
classes whose positive signal blocks publication (ADR-0019 lane (b):
"a positive danger-detector signal quarantines it terminally"). It is
consumed by the fail-closed publication gate
(:func:`mnemos.pipeline.publish.publish_memory`); the secrets patterns
themselves are NOT duplicated here — the secret class **delegates** to
:func:`mnemos.secrets_detector.detect_secrets` (the existing single
source of truth for secret patterns, ArchCom 2026-07-17 §2.2.1) and
keeps only the high-confidence subset as a publication-blocking signal.

Enumerated detector classes (the "enumerated set" of ADR-0019):

* ``prompt-injection`` — the patterns originally introduced by the
  import-validation screen (issue #86) as **log-only**; they moved here
  (single source of truth) so the publication gate can classify them
  into lane (b) while the import screen keeps its warn-only behaviour
  by importing the same table. Case-insensitive substring matching —
  deliberately not regex, to avoid ReDoS on untrusted content.
* ``secret`` — high-confidence secret patterns only: the discrete
  structural patterns of :mod:`mnemos.secrets_detector` (aws-key,
  github-token, …). The ``high-entropy`` heuristic is deliberately
  excluded: it is a false-positive-tuned heuristic, not a
  high-confidence signal, and already drives the no-federate tag and
  the issuance redaction path.

Design constraints (mirroring :mod:`mnemos.secrets_detector`)
-------------------------------------------------------------

* **Pure function contract** — :func:`detect` never mutates its inputs,
  never logs, never keeps state. Logging/audit is the caller's business.
* **Fail-closed as a value, not an exception** — a detector/scanner
  error is returned inside the :class:`DetectionResult` (``error``
  set); it never propagates out of :func:`detect`. Callers treat a
  non-``None`` ``error`` as a refusal signal (fail-closed).
* **No raw values** — findings carry pattern names and counts ONLY.
  The matched text is never stored on the finding, so a finding cannot
  leak a secret or an injection payload into logs or audit records.

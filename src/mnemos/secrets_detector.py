"""Secrets detection scanner for the mnemos federation defence-in-depth.

This module is the **single source of truth** for secret-pattern detection
across mnemos. It is consumed by three defence-in-depth layers
(ArchCom 2026-07-17 federation contract §2.2.1):

* **Layer 1 — write-path scanner** (this issue, #86): wired into
  ``MemoryManager.add`` / ``mnemos_add`` / HTTP ``POST /memories`` /
  ``ingest_url`` / ``ingest_path_scoped_rules``. On detect → auto-add the
  ``mnemos:no-federate`` tag so the record is excluded from external
  exchange (batch sync + mediated pull).
* **Layer 2 — background scanner** (issue #89, future): a periodic job
  that re-scans the corpus for false negatives missed at write time.
  Re-uses ``detect_secrets`` unchanged (DRY).
* **Layer 3 — moderation pipeline** (Phase 0, issue #85, future): runs
  at export / pull as a final defence. Re-uses ``detect_secrets`` and
  ``redact_content`` unchanged.

Public API (stable — must NOT break Layer 2 / Layer 3 consumers):

* :class:`SecretFinding`  — dataclass describing one match.
* :func:`detect_secrets` — scan ``content`` and return findings.
* :func:`redact_content` — replace each match with ``<REDACTED:<name>>``.

Design constraints
------------------
* **Never log raw matched values.** ``SecretFinding.matched_value`` exists
  for programmatic use (redaction, masking) — logging code MUST use
  ``pattern_name`` + counts only.
* **Compiled patterns are module-level** so the regex compilation cost is
  paid once per process, not once per call.
* **High-entropy detection uses Shannon entropy** on base64-like spans.
  The threshold is tuned to limit false positives on normal English prose
  (see ``_HIGH_ENTROPY_THRESHOLD`` docstring).
* **Overlapping patterns** are resolved by first-match precedence: the
  scanner sorts matches by start position and, for ties, by the order in
  which patterns are declared. Earlier-declared patterns win.

# an OpenAI ``sk-`` token only if the literal differs; precedence is still
# well-defined because the start offsets differ). The list is deliberately
# ordered: specific high-signal patterns first, generic high-entropy last.

# All test fixtures MUST use obviously fake values (see
# ``sensitive-data.instructions.md``). Real credentials never appear in

# ── High-entropy detection ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Shannon entropy on base64-like spans. A span is "base64-like" if it is a
# long run of ``[A-Za-z0-9+/=_-]``. We compute Shannon entropy on the span
# and flag it when the entropy exceeds ``_HIGH_ENTROPY_THRESHOLD``.
#
# Threshold choice (documented):
#   - English prose has Shannon entropy ~3.5-4.5 bits/char when measured
#     over the full ASCII alphabet, but base64 spans are constrained to
#     64 symbols; within those spans normal text rarely exceeds ~4.2.
#   - Random base64 (keys, tokens) sits at ~5.5-6.0 bits/char.
#   - We set the threshold to **4.8 bits/char** with a minimum span length
#     of **32 chars** to suppress short matches (common identifiers like
#     ``someVariableName`` have high per-char entropy but short length).
#   - Tuned against the test suite (true positive: 40-char base64 key;
#     false positive: a 200-word English paragraph must NOT match).

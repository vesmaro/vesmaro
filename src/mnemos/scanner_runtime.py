"""Process-wide background scanner singleton.

Layer 2 of the federation defence-in-depth (ArchCom 2026-07-17 contract
§2.2.1). The scanner is constructed lazily from the same
:class:`~mnemos.config.Settings` as the :class:`~mnemos.manager.MemoryManager`
and started/stopped alongside the background processor in the MCP server
and HTTP API lifespans.

The singleton lives here (rather than on ``MemoryManager``) so the
scanner stays an optional, separately-configured component — disabling
it via ``scanner.enabled = False`` does not touch the manager.

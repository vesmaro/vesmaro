"""Workflow lifecycle state machine for memories (mnemos #96).

Separates mutable *workflow state* (this module: open → in-progress → done,
blocked/resolved, terminal states) from append-only *classification* (the
tag contract: ``project:X``, ``mnemos:decision``). The tag layer stays
append-only; this layer is the mutable lifecycle.

The state machine is pure: it knows nothing about SQLite, locks, or the
manager. ``MemoryManager.workflow_set`` is the ONLY place that calls
``validate_transition`` before writing — enforcement is server-side, so
neither the MCP tool nor the REST endpoints can bypass it.

State diagram (mnemos #96, ArchCom 2026-07-18)::

    open ─────────────▶ in-progress ─────────────▶ done          (normal path)
             ▲              │   ▲
             │              ▼   │
             │           blocked ◀──────────────── (stuck)
             │              │
             │              ▼
             └─────── resolved ───────────────────▶ (back to in-progress or done)

    blocked → done   FORBIDDEN  (blocker must resolve first)
    done, withdrawn  terminal   (no further transitions)

The forbidden ``blocked → done`` edge forces a blocker to go through
``resolved`` before a memory can be marked done — an agent cannot silently
skip a stuck dependency by jumping straight to a terminal state.

"""Entry point for the `mnemos-train` console script (ADR-0021 NM track).

`training/` is a repo-local top-level package, deliberately excluded from the
wheel (training happens outside the server runtime — ADR-0021 anti-scope).
This wrapper resolves the repo-local module when it exists (editable/dev
installs, toolbox containers with the repo mounted) and fails loud with
actionable guidance when it does not (plain wheel installs of the server).

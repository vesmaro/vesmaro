"""Publish stage — M4: status=processed→published + vector index upsert.

Only status="published" ever enters the vector index.
This is the key invariant that keeps hybrid recall high-signal.

ADR-0019 Phase A: the stage carries the fail-closed **danger gate** —
the point where entry admissibility is flagged. Before the status flip,
every publication attempt (including the Hermes-style
``skip_quality_check`` bypass — the gate is separate from the quality
check) must pass the enumerated danger detectors
(:mod:`mnemos.danger_detectors`) over the served projection and the
title. A detector/scanner error or a positive signal (prompt injection,
high-confidence secret) refuses the publication: the record stays
stored (zero-loss) and invisible. Storage is never blocked — only the
visibility transition is.

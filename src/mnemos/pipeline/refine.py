"""Refine worker — ADR-0019 Phase B2a: async refinement of pending rows.

The optimistic-publication semantics (ADR-0019): an entry is visible the
moment it passes the ingest gate; THIS worker owns the async half — it
picks rows by ``pipeline_state='pending'`` (plus ``failed`` rows with
retry budget left), claims one atomically, produces a refined projection
and swaps it in place on the SAME row (same id, stable rowid) in a
single ``update_fields`` transaction.

Outcome lanes (§5):

* ``refined``       — an artifact exists: transactionally swapped
  (``content`` ← projection, ``clean_content`` reset so the swap is not
  masked by ``effective_content()``, ``swap_key`` idempotency by analogy
  with ``synthesis_cache_key``). The vector re-embed happens AFTER the
  commit, outside the transaction; a failed upsert is healed later by
  the idempotent sweeper (``MemoryManager.heal_stale_embeddings``).
* ``refined-noop``  — the deterministic stub synthesis has nothing
  meaningful to add (a lone entry with no admissible cluster context):
  the row transitions pending→refined WITHOUT touching the content — an
  honest "checked, nothing to improve", never a swap of the raw text
  for a placeholder.
* ``failed``        — lane (a): quality/infra error. The entry STAYS
  visible raw (status untouched); retry with exponential backoff, the
  attempt counter in ``metadata`` (the schema is closed since B1 — no
  new column), at most ``REFINE_MAX_ATTEMPTS`` attempts, then stable.
* ``quarantined``   — lane (b): a POSITIVE danger-detector signal on the
  PROCESSED projection (a secret or injection introduced by the
  processing itself is caught exactly here), or detector/scanner
  ambiguity — fail-closed in both directions (§5: ambiguity quarantines,
  it does not retry). Terminal until ``release_quarantine``.

The legacy RAW→PROCESSING clustering flow is NOT this queue: NULL
pipeline_state rows keep their pre-ADR-0019 semantics (Phase D decides
their retirement).

B2b §2 (curated visibility): both completion points (the swap and the
honest noop) hand the row to ``MemoryManager._curated_publish`` — in
``curated`` deployments the row is still RAW there, and the refined
projection receives its visibility through the same publication gate
(clean ⇒ PUBLISHED + embed; refusal ⇒ lane-(b) quarantine). Immediate
deployments skip it (visibility was granted at ingest).

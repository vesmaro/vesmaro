"""ADR-0025 E1 — deterministic retrieval lanes (mnemos #253).

Lanes are a **recall SUB-STAGE** of ``assemble_context`` (``assemble.py``):
when ``LanesConfig.enabled`` is on, several candidate sources merge into
one ``_Candidate`` list inside the recall stage; downstream stages (ccr →
filter → scan → align → budget) never change — ``STAGE_ORDER`` stays the
same six stages and ``hooks.py`` is untouched. When the flag is off (the
default) the code path is IDENTICAL to the pre-E1 pipeline: no lane
queries run, and the assembled output is byte-identical (the ``lane``
block field is omitted entirely when off — a present-but-different key
set would already be an output change).

The lanes (ADR-0025 §Architecture):

* **rules / decisions** — deterministic SQL over the existing flat store
  via ``list_all(tags=...)`` (the pattern ``recall_context`` in
  ``manager.py`` already uses); no schema change, no new index.
* **knowledge** — the existing hybrid RRF recall, with governance-tagged
  rows EXCLUDED (they surface via their own deterministic lanes; leaving
  them in the RRF leg too would re-create the drowning lanes exist to
  fix and duplicate blocks).
* **checkpoints** — NOT a pre_llm_call lane. They stay on the existing
  ``on_session_start`` → ``recall_context`` bootstrap channel and are
  deliberately not pinned into ``pre_llm_call`` permanently (gap-fallback
  is an experimental variable, not v0 behavior).

Lane ordering (the H2 KV-cache surface): the budget stage sorts
candidates by ``(lane order, score desc)`` with a stable tiebreak — the
byte-stable prefix between assemblies of one session is the KV-cache
hypothesis H2 surface (E0 §2.2). Lane order is fixed:
``rules → decisions → knowledge``.

Tag contract: CLOSED. ``area:`` is NOT added to
``ALLOWED_OPTIONAL_PREFIXES``; the closed ``MNEMOS_TAG_SUBTYPES`` set
keeps ``mnemos:rule`` / ``mnemos:decision`` as the only lane selectors.

── Cascade-ready contracts (fields only, no mechanics — R2) ──────────

* The lane enum includes ``synthesized`` from day one. NOTHING populates
  it in E1 — the collapse cascade will. ``synthesized`` is a collapsed
  projection of knowledge entries, so it sorts AFTER the pinned
  pre_llm_call prefix (never inside it — a derived segment outranking
  its sources would break the governance guarantee).
* ``collapse_level`` lives in memory **metadata** — the metadata key is
  exactly ``collapse_level``. Never a tag (the tag contract is closed),
  never a schema column (the store stays flat).
* Already landed in slice 1 and NOT redone here: the ``origin=``
  provenance segment (PR #262, ``build_provenance`` in ``assemble.py``)
  and the 4-component idempotency key
  ``hash(scope_key, prompt_version, model_version, input_set_hash)``
  (PR #260). The cascade composes with both.

── Awareness-ready contracts (fields only — R3) ───────────────────────

* **Per-agent delta slot** — CONVENTION for the future awareness module,
  no runtime code: one agent contributes AT MOST one delta block to an
  assembly. This is the structural anti-DoS bound (an agent cannot flood
  the context with N delta blocks) and the accounting unit for D1.
* **Awareness cursor keys** — ``awr:`` + the LENGTH-PREFIXED
  ``(project, agent, session)`` tuple (``awareness_cursor_key``; plain
  ``:``-joins alias when a session id contains ``:`` — #251 sessions
  are printable-ASCII and legally may) in the existing ``meta``
  key-value table, written with the UPSERT pattern
  (precedent: ``session_agent_binding``, PR #263). The tiny read/write
  helpers below are the ONLY runtime piece; the awareness module that
  consumes them arrives later.
* **Awareness renders LAST** — the awareness block composes at the tail
  of the assembled output, NEVER inside the pinned lane prefix (a
  dynamic per-agent block inside the prefix would destroy the byte-stable
  H2 surface). ``assert_foreign_lanes_tail_only`` is the assertion-style
  guard the budget stage runs POST-SORT when lanes are enabled:
  ``lane_sort_key`` already maps any foreign lane (``synthesized``
  today, the future awareness lane) into the deterministic tail, so the
  guard is defensive only — it fires if a future code path ever bypasses
  the sort and places a foreign lane before a pinned-lane block.

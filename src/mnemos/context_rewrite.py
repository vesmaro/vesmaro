"""ADR-0018 — ``on_context_rewrite`` lifecycle event (mnemos #125, Wave 2).

The harness (zcode or any MCP-capable peer) owns the *replacement policy*:
when it rewrites a block inside its own context window it emits this event
so the original becomes losslessly recoverable. The provider owns the
*guarantees*: zero-loss storage, secret scan, provenance, status gate.

Event semantics (ADR-0018 §"on_context_rewrite", verbatim requirements):

* **Idempotent** — re-delivery of the same rewrite event performs no
  duplicate writes. The idempotency key is content-addressed (the CCR
  house style): SHA-256 over the length-prefixed canonical tuple
  ``(project, agent, session, supersedes, content)``. The advisory
  ``diff`` is DELIBERATELY excluded from the key — it is not load-bearing,
  so a re-delivery carrying a different advisory diff is still the same
  event and deduplicates into the first memory. The key is persisted as
  ``metadata["rewrite_event_key"]`` and looked up before any write.
* **Version-less** — the event promises NO ordering and NO version
  chains. What would be a "version pair" elsewhere is a ``supersedes``
  edge (``memory_edges``, kind ``supersedes`` — the Phase 1 minimal
  surface); traversal/expansion is Phase 2 (ADR-0017 D2) and runs under
  the entry invariant when it arrives.
* **Pipeline entry** — the original goes through the NORMAL knowledge
  path (``MemoryManager.add``): it enters at ``raw`` and is context-
  reachable only after the pipeline advances it to ``processed`` /
  ``published`` (``CONTEXT_ADMISSIBLE_STATUSES`` gate). The Layer-1
  write-path secret scan runs inside ``add`` (a hit auto-tags
  ``mnemos:no-federate``). Rehydrate is the EXISTING scanned/gated path —
  ``mnemos_retrieve`` / ``assemble_context`` — never a new one.
* **Advisory diff** — caller-supplied, stored as metadata
  (``rewrite_diff``), never load-bearing and never echoed in responses.
  Because the diff becomes part of the persisted record, it gets its own
  Layer-1 verdict: a secret in the diff also auto-tags the record
  ``mnemos:no-federate`` (otherwise the advisory payload would federate
  unflagged through a channel that only scans ``content``), and the
  verdict is recorded as ``rewrite_diff_scan_verdict`` (clean | hit |
  unknown — the P1-a ``ccr_cache`` vocabulary). Zero-loss: the diff is
  stored verbatim either way.
* **Marker** — the CCR marker stays in the harness window (caller-side).
  When the caller asks (``include_marker=True``) the event returns the
  compress marker for the original via the existing ``compress_content``
  (content-addressed, project-scoped, Layer-1 scanned at write).

Write-surface guardrails (#125 W2 security review, finding 1 — these are
preconditions for the W3 automation slice):

* **Rate limit** — two-level (C10, ArchCom 2026-08-27). PRIMARY:
  ``mnemos.context_rewrite_rate_limit_per_minute`` (default 30, 0 disables)
  counts STORED events per ``(project, session)`` in a one-minute window
  (the #96 guardrail-5 SQL pattern over ``memories``). SECONDARY:
  ``mnemos.context_rewrite_project_rate_limit_per_minute`` (default 300,
  0 disables) caps the per-project AGGREGATE — total stored events across
  all sessions of the project per minute, with the distinct-session count
  reported in the 429 message as the noisy-neighbor signal. Both count
  writes, not deliveries: a deduplicated re-delivery performs no write
  and consumes no quota, so at-least-once retry storms stay harmless.
  NULL-session events form their own bucket under both knobs. Over-limit
  raises :class:`ContextRewriteRateLimitError` — a backpressure signal,
  NOT a validation failure (REST maps it to 429, MCP to a clean error
  dict; ``ValueError`` remains 422/``{"error": …}``). Residual risk
  (ADR-0018-accepted): the aggregate ceiling introduces a noisy-neighbor
  channel — one busy project can starve its siblings on a shared node;
  accepted for the single-operator deployment, revisit on the first
  multi-harness adapter.
* **Size caps** — ``mnemos.context_rewrite_max_content_chars`` (default
  1 MiB in chars) and ``mnemos.context_rewrite_max_diff_chars`` (default
  256 KiB in chars) reject oversized payloads at the boundary before
  any write.

Supersedes scoping (#125 W2 security review, finding 2): the target must
exist AND belong to the caller's project — the pre-flight message is
deliberately identical for "no such memory" and "memory of another
project" (no global existence oracle, mirroring the P1-a ``ccr_get``
project-scoping semantics).

Design decisions (flagged for ArchCom ratification in the #125 report):

* **Idempotency key** — content-hash over the canonical tuple, not a
  caller-supplied event id: the harness cannot fabricate collisions, and
  identical re-deliveries dedupe even when the caller lost its event id.
  Two identical blocks replaced in two different sessions are two events
  (``session`` participates in the key) and store twice — correct, they
  are distinct windows.
* **Provenance shape** — ``metadata["source"] = "context-rewrite"`` plus
  ``metadata["rewrite_session"]``; the project/agent identity lives in
  the tag contract (``project:<slug>`` / ``agent:<slug>`` tags, enforced
  via ``validate_tag_contract`` with the caller's strictness knob).
  ``Memory.source`` stays ``MemorySource.MCP`` — the event arrives from
  the harness over the MCP/REST surface like every other tool call.
* **No new retrieval surface** — deliberately. The rehydrate roundtrip is
  verified in tests through ``assemble_context`` / ``mnemos_retrieve``.

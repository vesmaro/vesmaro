"""P1-5 — CacheAligner: prefix stabilization for provider KV cache hits.

Inspired by headroom's CacheAligner
(https://github.com/headroomlabs-ai/headroom, Apache 2.0). This is an
original implementation — no headroom code is imported.

Problem
-------
Provider prefix caches (Anthropic ``cache_control``, OpenAI prefix caching)
hit only when the *prefix* of a prompt is byte-identical across requests.
System prompts that embed dynamic values (timestamps, UUIDs, session ids,
short-lived tokens) near the top break the cache on every request — the
cache misses at the first differing byte.

Solution
--------
Extract dynamic spans from the text, relocate them to a
``--- Dynamic context ---`` block at the *end*, and leave a stable prefix
behind. The prefix up to the first dynamic span becomes cache-stable; the
dynamic values still reach the model, just from the tail.

The extractor is conservative: it only matches well-formed dynamic
literals (ISO timestamps, UUIDs, ``sess-``/``session:`` ids, bare hex/base64
tokens of sufficient entropy). Code identifiers, file paths, and prose are
not mangled.

Determinism: same input always produces the same output (patterns are
applied in a fixed order; extracted spans are sorted by position).

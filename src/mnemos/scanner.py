"""Background secrets scanner — Layer 2 of the federation defence-in-depth.

ArchCom 2026-07-17 federation contract §2.2.1 — the background scanner
periodically re-scans the whole mnemos corpus for secrets missed by the
write-path scanner (Layer 1) and auto-tags ``mnemos:no-federate`` so the
record is excluded from all external exchange (batch sync + mediated
pull). It catches false negatives:

* the LLM did not tag the record at write time,
* a pattern was added to :mod:`mnemos.secrets_detector` after the record
  was written,
* the record was updated via ``manager.update`` without re-running the
  scanner (mitigated by the #86 S-2 fix, but the scanner is still the
  safety net).

Design constraints
------------------
* **DRY** — re-uses :func:`mnemos.secrets_detector.detect_secrets`
  unchanged. The scanner NEVER re-implements a pattern. Layer 1 and
  Layer 2 share one source of truth.
* **No raw values in logs/audit** — only pattern names and counts.
  ``SecretFinding.matched_value`` is never logged, never written to the
  audit JSONL.
* **Thread-safe** — the scanner runs in a background daemon thread. The
  scan itself is read-only (it calls ``detect_secrets`` on each
  record's content); the tag update uses ``manager.update`` which is
  atomic at the SQLite level (single ``UPDATE`` statement).
* **Non-blocking** — the background thread never blocks the MCP server
  or HTTP API. A scan pass runs to completion or fails non-fatally; the
  interval timer waits for the previous pass to finish before starting
  the next one.
* **Idempotent** — a record that already carries ``mnemos:no-federate``
  is counted as ``skipped`` and never re-tagged. Running the scanner
  twice on the same corpus tags 0 records on the second pass.
* **Configurable** — interval, enabled/disabled, incremental/full.

Public API
----------
* :class:`BackgroundScanner` — start/stop the background loop, run a
  one-shot scan.
* :class:`ScanResult` — frozen dataclass returned by ``run_scan``.

    ``manager.update`` which is atomic at the SQLite level. The
    background thread holds no lock across the scan — a concurrent
    write simply means the scanner may see a slightly newer snapshot on

"""MnemosSDK — the thin typed facade over :class:`mnemos.manager.MemoryManager`.

The programmatic contract surface for adapters (mnemos #125, Wave 3):
the Hermes migration (next wave) and any in-process harness consume the
memory server through THIS class instead of weaving manager calls into
adapter code. Local-first by construction — the SDK talks to the
manager directly (no HTTP/MCP hop); remote deployments use the MCP /
REST surfaces, which call the same manager methods.

The facade owns no DOMAIN logic — validation, gating, idempotency, and
observability live in the manager paths exactly as the MCP/REST surfaces
see them. Two channel-boundary duties are the facade's OWN, mirroring
what every other surfaced channel does at its edge (W3 security review
F1/F2):

* ``recall`` scans every echoed item at issuance
  (``MemoryManager.scan_issuance_item`` over content + title —
  per-item redactions, refuse-mode drop), exactly like the
  ``mnemos_search`` / REST ``/search`` channels. The SDK returns
  SCANNED item dicts, never stored rows.
* ``remember`` validates caller-supplied tags against the tag contract
  (``validate_tag_contract``, deployment strictness knob), exactly like
  the ``mnemos_add`` / REST write channels.

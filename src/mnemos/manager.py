        ``trusted_rewrite_provenance`` (C10 review round) is set ONLY by
        the rewrite-event path (``context_rewrite``): it lets

        ``data.metadata``. The generic create surfaces (REST/MCP/CLI)

        never mint rewrite quota counters.

        A9 (ArchCom 2026-08-27) — project scoping is PRE-RRF on BOTH legs:
        the FTS leg passes ``project`` to ``fts_search`` as before, and the
        vector leg now applies a native store-level project predicate
        (embedding metadata) plus an authoritative resolve-time guard on
        the SQLite ``Memory.project``, both BEFORE fusion — out-of-project
        rows never surface and never consume RRF rank slots. ``project``
        of ``None`` (or empty) is the EXPLICIT global mode: the search is
        cross-project by definition and is counted in
        ``search_stats()["cross_project_requests_total"]`` for audit.

        Status filtering precedence:
          1. Explicit ``status`` — always wins (caller knows what they want).
          2. ``include_raw=True`` — all statuses EXCEPT ``archived`` are
             returned. ``archived`` means "intentionally hidden from normal
             search" and is excluded unless the caller passes
             ``status=MemoryStatus.ARCHIVED`` explicitly.
          3. Default (``include_raw=False``, no ``status``) — only
             ``published`` and ``processed`` memories surface, preserving the
             documented "Only searches 'published' knowledge units by default"
             contract.

        ADR-0019 §5 — on every status-filtered leg (2 and 3 above) the
        quarantine predicate composes with the allowed set AND holds
        absolutely on its own: ``pipeline_state='quarantined'`` rows are
        excluded from issuance REGARDLESS of status — an EXPLICIT
        ``status=`` drill-down included (quarantined rows carry
        status='published', and the external payloads carry no
        pipeline_state, so the caller could not even detect the
        contamination). Direct ``get`` by id stays the documented
        residual access until the B2 retraction render.

        ADR-0019 §4 — ``refined_only=True`` additionally keeps only
        entries whose served projection is the refined one
        (``pipeline_state='refined'``); NULL/legacy pipeline_state rows

        Shared commit path for ``tags_rename`` / ``tags_remove`` / ``tags_add``
        (the grouped ``mnemos_tags`` MCP tool). Keeping the contract check and
        the ``update_fields`` write in one place guarantees every tag mutation
        goes through the same FTS5-safe ``UPDATE`` (the ``memories_au`` trigger
        fires) and the same ``validate_tag_contract`` gate.

        Args:
            mem: The memory row currently being processed.
            new_tags: The desired tag list for ``mem``.
            dry_run: When ``True`` nothing is written; the caller still counts
                the memory as "would change" so the report reflects intent.
            strict: Contract-validation mode for the resulting tag set.

                ``False`` (default, used by ``tags_rename``) — *lax*: a missing
                ``project:`` / ``agent:`` / ``mnemos:`` tag, an invalid
                ``mnemos:`` subtype, or a malformed slug is auto-patched in the
                returned list rather than rejected. Rename is a prefix swap
                (``gcw:`` → ``mnemos:``) that preserves required tags, so lax is
                the correct, non-corrupting mode there.

                ``True`` (used by ``tags_remove`` / ``tags_add``) — *strict*:
                any contract violation (including the soft ones lax would
                patch) raises ``TagContractError``, which this method reports as
                a per-memory error and skips the write. ``remove`` / ``add`` are
                explicit mutations, so a contract-breaking result (e.g. removing
                the last ``project:``, or adding an invalid ``mnemos:`` subtype)
                is rejected per memory instead of corrupting the store.

        Returns:
            ``(changed, error)``. ``changed`` is ``True`` when ``new_tags``
            differs from ``mem.tags`` AND passes the contract gate (and, when
            not ``dry_run``, the ``UPDATE`` succeeded). ``error`` is the
            ``"<id>: <reason>"`` string to append to the report's ``errors``
            list when validation or the write raised; ``None`` otherwise.

        Note:
            Re-derives the denormalised ``project`` / ``agent`` columns from
            the new tag set so a prefix change that touched ``project:`` /
            ``agent:`` keeps the denormalised columns aligned with the tags
            (otherwise per-project / per-agent queries drift). For the common
            ``gcw:`` → ``mnemos:`` rename these are unchanged.

                describes what *would* happen. When ``False`` the rename is

            project: Scope the scan to a single project slug (pre-filters
                via ``list_all(project=...)`` to reduce rows inspected).
            agent: Scope the scan to a single agent slug.
            invalid_subtypes_to_legacy: When ``False`` (default) a tag whose
                subtype is not in ``MNEMOS_TAG_SUBTYPES`` is skipped and
                counted in ``skipped_invalid``. When ``True`` it is renamed
                to ``<to_prefix>legacy`` instead.

        Returns:
            ``{"scanned": N, "renamed": N, "changed": N, "skipped_invalid": N,
            "errors": [...]}``. ``changed`` mirrors ``renamed`` so every
            ``mnemos_tags`` action (rename/remove/add) exposes a ``changed``
            key for a uniform report shape; ``renamed`` is kept for back-compat
            with existing ``mnemos_tags_rename`` callers. In dry-run mode
            ``renamed`` reflects what *would* be renamed; nothing is written.

        Idempotency:
            A second run with the same arguments returns ``renamed=0``
            because the ``from_prefix:`` tags no longer exist.

        Vector store:
            The vector index is keyed by ``memory_id`` (see
            ``VectorStore.upsert``) and the embedded text is derived from
            ``title + content + tags`` (see ``_embedding_text``). Tags ARE
            part of the embedded text, so renaming tags *technically*
            changes the embedding input. However, re-embedding on every
            tag rename is expensive and the tag contribution to semantic
            similarity is small relative to content. We deliberately do
            NOT re-embed here — semantic search continues to work because
            the stored vectors still point to the same memory ids and the
            FTS5 leg (which DOES reflect the new tags via the AFTER UPDATE
            trigger) carries tag-filtered queries. If exact tag-vector
            alignment is required, run ``mnemos reindex`` afterwards.

            wildcard: Prefix match (``True``) vs exact match (``False``, default).
            dry_run: Preview only when ``True`` (default).

            ``tags_rename``. The resulting tag set is validated in **strict**
            mode: removing the last ``project:`` / ``agent:`` / ``mnemos:`` tag
            (or otherwise breaking the contract) is rejected per memory with an
            error entry instead of corrupting the store. Idempotent: a second

        content-echoing channels (MCP ``mnemos_filter``, REST
        ``POST /filter/{id}``) must call; it enforces the ADR-0018 entry
        invariant on the echoed ``clean_content``:

        * **status gate** — only ``CONTEXT_ADMISSIBLE_STATUSES``
          (``published`` / ``processed``) memories are filterable into
          context; ``raw`` / ``processing`` / ``archived`` refuse
          (fail-closed) instead of echoing stored raw content. ADR-0019
          §5 composes the quarantine exception into the same predicate:
          ``pipeline_state='quarantined'`` refuses identically
          (terminal danger-lane state, excluded from issuance).
        * **project scope** — with ``project`` given, the memory must
          belong to it; the error deliberately does not distinguish
          "no such memory" from "another project's memory" (same
          wording discipline as the ``supersedes`` check — no global
          existence oracle). Without ``project`` the call is explicit
          operator semantics, mirroring ``GET /memories/{id}`` which
          reads by id without a caller project.
        * **issuance scan** — the returned ``clean_content`` passes
          :meth:`scan_issuance_item`; refuse mode drops the content
          (error shape, no echo) exactly like the other issuance
          channels, redact mode returns the redacted copy plus
          ``redactions`` / ``redacted_patterns`` counts.

        Returns ``{"status": "error", "error": …, "reason": …}`` on any
        gate failure (``reason`` ∈ ``not_found`` / ``status_gate`` /
        ``project_scope`` / ``refused``) and the ``apply_context_filter``
        success shape (plus redaction counts) otherwise. The stored
        filter fields are updated exactly as before — storage stays
        zero-loss; only the echo is scanned.

        Strong-form gate for the W3 automation rehydrate channel
        (committee decision ``archcom-2026-08-27-deferrals-triage``):
        existence-only validation does NOT catch same-project seeding,
        so all three checks run:

        * **existence** — the row must exist under ``(project, hash)``
          (project-scoped after A1). Strict validation REQUIRES a
          project scope: an unscoped lookup would redeem a marker
          against the first-stored copy of any project.
        * **integrity** — the marker's ``original_chars`` (the N parsed
          from ``[compressed: <hash> | N→M chars | …]``) must equal the
          character length of the stored original. ``None`` fails
          (fail-closed: an unverifiable dimension is a failed
          dimension).
        * **provenance** — the row's issuer ledger
          (``issuer_agent``/``issuer_session``, recorded at store time)
          must match the caller's trusted issuer context: the stored
          ``(agent, session)`` pair must be a member of
          ``trusted_issuers``. The minimal sound spec for W3 automation
          is exactly one pair — its OWN ``(agent, session)`` — so a
          hook redeems only markers minted in its own context; an
          explicit allowlist is the same predicate with more pairs. A
          spec session of ``None`` matches only NULL issuer sessions
          (component-wise equality, never wildcards). Rows stored
          without identity (legacy migration or identity-less callers)
          are UNVERIFIABLE and fail with the distinct reason
          ``unverifiable legacy marker``; an empty spec fails with
          ``no trusted issuer context``.

        Residual (ADR-0018 residual register, accepted, A2 review round
        wording): with strict mode enabled, marker redemption is
        ADVERSARY-RESISTANT for issuer-stamped rows (post-A2 stores carry
        the ledger) — refusal reasons are FIXED non-oracle strings (A2
        review F1: a reason echoing the stored length or issuer pair is a
        two-call oracle that defeats provenance). Legacy NULL-issuer rows
        are unverifiable by construction: full-shape validation refuses
        them, hash-only retrieval under strict mode stays ALLOWED with a
        WARNING (refusing would brick all pre-A2 caches for zero
        marginal adversary resistance — see retrieve_content F2). The
        same-project seeding residual is unchanged: a trusted harness
        with compress access can still seed content inside its own
        project and redeem from the same identity; single-operator
        threat model, revisit on the first multi-principal trigger.

        Args:
            h: SHA-256 hash from the marker (validated by existence).
            project: Project scope; ``None``/empty fails existence
                (strict validation requires the scope).
            original_chars: N from the marker; ``None`` fails integrity.
            trusted_issuers: Set of ``(agent, session | None)`` pairs
                allowed to have minted the marker. Components are
                stripped and empty sessions normalised to ``None``
                (mirroring the ``ccr_store`` issuer normalisation — A2
                review F4); agents must be non-empty strings

            ``integrity`` / ``provenance``) for the refusal reason.
            Reasons are FIXED strings carrying no stored values (F1).
            The read is unbumped (``bump=False``): a failed validation

        is MARKER-SHAPED when it carries any of ``original_chars`` /
        ``agent`` / ``session`` (the metadata a harness parses out of a
        ``[compressed: <hash> | N→M chars | …]`` marker plus its own
        identity). When strict mode is on (per-call ``validate_marker``
        override, else the ``ccr.validate_markers`` knob) a marker-shaped
        request must first pass :meth:`validate_marker` — existence
        (project-scoped), ``original_chars`` integrity, and provenance
        against the caller's own ``(agent, session)`` issuer context —
        and any failed check returns the refused shape with
        ``reason="marker validation failed: <check>: <detail>"`` and NO
        content (fail-closed; reasons are FIXED non-oracle strings — A2
        review F1). Review F2 closes the strip-the-args bypass: in
        strict mode a HASH-ONLY retrieve of an ISSUER-STAMPED row is
        refused with ``reason="marker validation required"`` (no
        content); legacy NULL-issuer rows stay redeemable hash-only
        with a WARNING (unverifiable by construction — refusing would
        brick pre-A2 caches; the register wording lives in
        :meth:`validate_marker`). An explicit ``validate_marker=False``
        disables both gates (operator escape hatch). A refused
        validation never bumps the retrieval counter (F4 semantics
        preserved). Review N1: successful responses NEVER echo the
        issuer ledger — ``issuer_agent``/``issuer_session`` are internal
        gate data stripped before any success path returns.

        ADR-0018 P0 — issuance secret scan. Every retrieval is scanned
        with ``detect_secrets`` (patterns evolve and stored records age,
        so a store-time verdict alone would go stale): matched spans in
        the RETURNED payload — full original or FTS5 snippets — are
        replaced with ``<REDACTED:<pattern>>``. The stored original is
        never mutated (zero-loss storage). The response carries
        ``redactions`` (number of redacted spans; ``0`` when clean) and,
        when non-zero, ``redacted_patterns`` (log-safe per-pattern
        counts — raw matched values never leave storage). When
        ``ccr.retrieve_refuse_on_secret`` is enabled, a detection
        returns ``refused=True`` with no content instead of a redacted
        copy. ``found=False`` responses are returned unchanged.

        ADR-0018 P1-a — project scoping: ``project`` scopes the cache
        lookup to that project's entries; a hash cached under another
        project returns ``found=False`` (cross-session marker redemption
        denied, fail-closed). The manager holds no ambient project
        context, so the default is ``None`` = unscoped lookup (legacy
        behavior preserved for callers without project context); the
        explicit parameter is the override. The scan-at-store verdict on
        the row is observability only and never fast-paths this scan.

        ADR-0018 P1-b — issuance hardening:

        * CWE-668 ergonomics (Security findings 1+4): retrieving a
          project-scoped entry with ``project=None`` logs a WARNING; with
          ``ccr.require_project_match`` (default False) the issuance is
          denied instead (``refused=True``, ``reason`` names the scope
          requirement).
        * m2 — FTS5 snippets are scanned on a marker-stripped copy
          (highlight markers split multi-token secrets); when the
          snippet cannot be mapped onto the original, the WHOLE
          snippet is withheld (``<REDACTED:snippet>``) because
          stripped-copy offsets do not map back to the marked snippet.
        * B5 tier-1 (ArchCom 2026-08-27) — verdict-gated snippet refusal:
          entries whose scan-at-store verdict is ``'hit'`` refuse the
          snippet mode entirely (``reason="snippet mode unavailable for
          entries with detected secrets"``, no snippets emitted, no
          retrieval-counter bump) — snippet windows cannot be proven
          secret-free without the tier-2 offset mapping. NULL /
          'unknown' / 'clean' rows snippet as before; the full-original
          retrieve of a hit row stays available and is redacted
          span-wise by the P0 scan below.
        * B5 tier-2 (W3) — offset-mapped snippet scan for NULL /
          'unknown' / 'clean' rows: the snippet's ellipsis-split
          fragments are localized in the cached original (W1 CCR-stage
          exact-substring localization; each fragment must be UNIQUE),
          the original is scanned over the localized window ±
          ``SNIPPET_SCAN_MARGIN_CHARS``, and every finding INTERSECTING
          the window is redacted span-wise in the emitted snippet —
          closing the window-truncation fragment (a secret cut by the
          32-token FTS5 window edge evades snippet-text detection but
          not the original-window scan). A non-localizable snippet
          falls back to the tier-1 m2 withholding above (fail-closed).
        * m5 — a scanner exception maps to the refused shape with
          ``reason="scanner error"`` (fail-closed, observable) instead
          of propagating as a 500 / MCP error.
        * review F4 — the retrieval counter is bumped only when content
          is actually ISSUED (``ccr_touch`` after the decision; the
          entry is read via ``bump=False``): refused/denied issuances no
          longer inflate ``retrieval_count`` or LRU-pin the entry.

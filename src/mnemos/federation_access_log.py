"""Federation access log — B-side audit log (Phase 1 prerequisite).

ArchCom 2026-07-17 federation contract §10. A field/log on the B side
that records who queried what, when, with what trigger code, and which
records were returned. Used for **anti-correlation tracking**: B sees
that A already got ``EXHAUSTIVE`` on topic X → the next request on the
same topic returns ``ALREADY_EXHAUSTED`` (contract §9).

Privacy (КП-5, contract §0.п.8): the log stores **only** a SHA-256 hash
of the query topic, never the plaintext topic. This preserves the
query intent from a log leak while still allowing anti-correlation
matching (the same topic hashes to the same digest).

Storage (contract §10 "Где хранится"): the log lives **only on B**.
It is **never replicated**, never exported, never synced — like the
moderation mapping table, it is a leak surface. Phase 1 stores it as
an append-only JSONL file (``~/.mnemos/logs/federation-access.jsonl``)
so that an operator can inspect it with standard tools. Phase 2 will
wire the log into the federation server's request path.

Reference:
    - Contract §10: ``.archcom/sessions/2026-07-17-federation-contract.md``
    - КП-5 (query topic hashing): contract §0.п.8
    - ADR-0016: ``docs/project/adr/0016-federation-threat-model.md``

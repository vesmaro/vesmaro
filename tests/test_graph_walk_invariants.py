"""ADR-0030 A0 (issue #324) — Memory Graph walk invariants I1-I3.

The CLOSING slice of wave A0-1: the 1-hop ``relates_to`` walk (the
search graph leg's second edge kind, behind the default-OFF
``mnemos.graph_walk`` flag) may only ship BECAUSE these contract tests
exist — Security's "inert until codified" condition and the chair's
same-PR sequencing ruling (ArchCom 2026-09-15). The tests extend the
#315 two-test pattern to the second kind and to the three binding
invariants of ADR-0030 §4:

* **I1 worst-link** — a record reachable through an edge chain inherits
  the STRICTEST status/gate among ALL nodes of the path; gates bind to
  the QUERY SCOPE, never to the current traversal frontier. At the
  1-hop surface the path is anchor→neighbour: the surfaced row passes
  the query's gates on its OWN merits — it never rides the anchor's
  admissibility, and the gate consulted is the query's (project scope,
  explicit status drill-down), not "whatever the frontier passed".
* **I2 absorbing quarantine** — no path of any length, no expansion,
  touches the §5 quarantine (ADR-0019). An edge is never a quarantine
  side door — including under an explicit ``status=PUBLISHED``
  drill-down, where the quarantine check is the ONLY standing guard
  (quarantined rows carry status='published' and the allowed-set gate
  is skipped for drill-downs).
* **I3 post-gate weights** — edge weights participate in ranking only
  AFTER gate filtering; they never restore eligibility (a heavy edge
  does not buy a gated row back in) and never REMOVE it (a light edge
  does not pre-filter an eligible row); the ADR-0028 id tiebreak stands
  (the A0 decay is a pure function of the fused ranking + edge table;
  the ``w_edge`` ranking formula is A1, #325).

MUTATION PROTOCOL — each named test below is mutation-verified: the
listed mutant (a minimal, plausible break of the invariant, applied to
``src/vesmaro/manager.py`` / the walk surface) turns the test RED; the
unmutated code is GREEN. The mutation runs are documented in the PR
body (mutant diff → failing test id → revert). Killers:

* ``test_i1_*`` — M1a strips the explicit-status drill-down check on
  graph rows; M1b strips the A9 project guard on graph rows.
* ``test_i2_*`` — M2 strips the absolute §5 quarantine check on graph
  rows.
* ``test_i3_*`` — M3a makes weights pre-filter eligibility in the
  walk; M3b lets a heavy edge bypass the status gate; M3c reorders the
  expansion block by edge weight (breaking the id-tiebreak line).

Test embedder: ``_HashEmbedder`` (deterministic hashed bag-of-tokens,
cosine ≈ token overlap) — same rationale as the minting suite: a
MagicMock embedder cannot discriminate and would fake the decay/
eligibility semantics. The ``_fts_only`` wipe pins neighbours to be
reachable ONLY through the edge under test (a fused row keeps its own
provenance and never exercises the walk gates).

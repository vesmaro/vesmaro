"""Cache contract Phase-1 (#280) — deterministic tiebreak in ``MemoryManager.search``.

The final RRF ordering in ``MemoryManager.search`` is ``(score desc, id
asc)``. Before Phase-1 the sort was ``reverse=True`` over the ``scores``
dict — stable over dict insertion order, which tracks the FTS/vector leg
iteration order; for EQUAL fused scores that order can depend on the
vector index state (the store's top-k tie behaviour), leaking
non-determinism into the retrieval boundary that feeds
``assemble_context`` (the KV-cache byte-stability surface of #305).

Test strategy: the equal-score construction needs rank control that the
real stores cannot provide (RRF contributions are per-rank, so two ids
tie only when their rank profiles sum to the same value — e.g. FTS rank
1 vs vector rank 1 under ``hybrid_alpha=0.5``). The fusion-boundary
tests therefore stub the two store-level search calls on the manager
instance (``fts_search`` / ``vectors.search``) with controlled pairs —
the REAL fusion, final sort and ``SearchResult`` construction code in
``MemoryManager.search`` runs unmodified. One store-level companion test
(distinct deterministic embeddings, shuffled insertion order) guards the
general "output is a pure function of content, not insertion order"
property end-to-end through the real stores.

Mutation check (verified by hand, not automated): reverting the sort key
to ``key=lambda kv: kv[1], reverse=True`` makes
``test_equal_fused_scores_order_by_id`` and
``test_shuffled_arrival_identical_output`` fail — the tests bite.

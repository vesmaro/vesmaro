"""Search v2 (issue #313) — graph leg v1 (memory_edges expansion).

``memory_edges`` (supersedes, ADR-0018 Phase 1) was unused by search —
a superseded record was invisible to a query that matched its
replacement. The graph leg v1 expands the top-``limit`` fused ids 1 hop
in BOTH directions (superseding→superseded and vice versa), appends
edge-sourced rows with a decayed RRF slot and ``via_graph=True``,
and passes the SAME status / quarantine / refined_only gates.

Decay rule (deterministic, documented in the code): an expansion row's
weight is ``1/(rrf_k + 2*anchor_rank)`` where anchor_rank is its first
anchor's 1-based position in the fused ranking — the appended block is a
pure function of the fused ranking + the edge table.

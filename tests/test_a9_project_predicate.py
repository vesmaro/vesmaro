"""A9 (ArchCom 2026-08-27) — pre-RRF project predicate in the vector leg.

Before A9, ``MemoryManager.search`` scoped only the FTS leg by project;
the vector leg resolved candidates from the WHOLE store, so a
project-scoped search could surface other projects' rows through the
vector resolve path. The fix is two-layer, both BEFORE RRF fusion:

* native store predicate — ``VectorStore.search(project=...)`` filters
  candidates on the embedding metadata's ``project`` (pre-top-k, so
  foreign rows never enter the candidate set);
* authoritative resolve-time guard — the SQLite ``Memory.project``
  (the source of truth) is re-checked before the candidate's score is
  fused, guarding against vector-metadata drift.

Also covered: the explicit global mode (``project=None``) stays
cross-project and is flagged in the search stats
(``cross_project_requests_total``); the 4x over-fetch never leaks past
``limit`` after fusion; and the interim assemble.py boundary drop
(``stats.recall.project_scoped_out``) is REMOVED — the systemic fix
supersedes the channel patch.

The mock embedder returns an identical vector for every text on purpose:
identical embeddings are the worst case for the old bug (the vector leg
could not prefer the in-project copy), so any leak here is structural,
not a ranking accident.

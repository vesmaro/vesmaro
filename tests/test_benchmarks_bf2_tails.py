"""BF-2 tail hardening tests — review findings #206 (F1) + #205 (F1) + #206 (N4).

* **s1m root isolation** (F1 #206): the S1m model leg MUST run under its
  own store root (``root/s1m``), never sharing the reference leg's
  ``vectors.db`` — sharing mixes 256-dim BLAKE2b vectors with 384-dim
  production ones in one store, ``np.stack`` then fails on every vector
  search and the leg silently degrades to FTS-only (measured,
  honest-looking, wrong). The test pins the CORRECT behaviour: distinct
  roots, distinct database files, and no cross-dim contamination.
* **pyproject floor guard** (F1 #205): the `mcp[cli]>=2.0,<3.0` floor
  from the #185 SDK-2.x port must not silently regress to `>=1.0` — a
  pip consumer could resolve an SDK that no longer matches the code.
  A 5-line guard parses pyproject and reddens on the floor's removal.

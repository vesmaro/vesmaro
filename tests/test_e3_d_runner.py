"""E3 D-leg runner — smoke tests over the REAL strata (D-runner wave).

These are RUNNER-MACHINERY gates, not an experiment run: collect-only
executes both arms over the real D-scenario strata through the REAL
awareness engine, validates the artifacts and persists NOTHING. The
first recorded D run stays a deliberate human decision after this
infrastructure merges (E0 anti-HARKing window).

Pins:

* dry-run over the real scenarios produces a WELL-FORMED manifest +
  paired outcomes without persisting a run;
* the leg flag ACTUALLY toggles the composition path: treatment calls
  ``compose_pre_llm_awareness`` once per scenario, control never does;
* the dap-001 contract (#286 residual): the adversarial actor goal
  comes from the runner's live session, never from the store — no
  actor row exists, the hint layer stays OFF for dap-001, no
  spoof-attributable deferral in either arm (E0 §5.4);
* the abstention chain is reconstructable from the store's traces
  alone (abstention → delta-block → checkpoint-id → writer-session);
* the statistics ban is schema — smuggled stat keys anywhere in the
  outcomes artifact are refused, and ``record_run`` routes through the
  gate;
* refusal without ``--record`` (zero writes); ``--record`` writes
  write-once, atomic artifacts; a re-record fails loud;
* the oracle tally layer on synthetic probe outcomes (independent of
  the real probe's behavior).

"""Search v2 (issue #313) — project soft fallback.

Live probe (production DB): a project-scoped search with a drifted slug
(``release-pipeline`` vs ``releases-pipeline``) returned 0 rows even
though the sought content existed under the sibling slug — the pre-v2
scope predicate was hard with no fallback, so scope drift made scoped
searches silently miss.

The fix is a NEW OUTER retry in ``MemoryManager.search`` (A9's pre-RRF
project predicate is untouched — the retry runs unscoped, in the
explicit global mode, with the SAME status/include_raw/refined_only
policy). Results that surface ONLY via the retry carry
``project_scope_fallback=True``; the event is audited via
``search_stats()["project_scope_fallback_total"]``.

Not retried: explicit ``status=`` drill-downs (a drill-down asserts the
row's lifecycle; an unscoped retry would resurface junk — the caller
keeps the zero, which is information).

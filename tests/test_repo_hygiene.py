"""Repo hygiene tripwires (#337 — gate integrity after the rebrand).

Two invariants that the canonical gates silently lost during the
``mnemos`` → ``vesmaro`` rename and the deploy waves:

1. **Venv canary (#335 class)** — the running pytest must come from THIS
   checkout's ``.venv``. The #335 incident had bare ``uv run pytest`` /
   ``make test`` fall through PATH to a foreign interpreter whose
   site-packages held a different vesmaro build: green locally, red (or
   silently wrong) in CI. ``tests/conftest.py`` pins *which code* is
   imported; this canary pins *which interpreter* runs it.
2. **Shim-only tripwire (#337 item 4)** — ``src/mnemos/`` must contain
   ONLY the dual-import shim ``__init__.py`` (ADR-0031). Every gate that
   once pointed at ``src/mnemos`` was measuring the shim, not the engine;
   new files landing there would re-create that blindness silently.

Both checks are ordinary suite members: they ride every CI matrix leg and
every local canonical run, which is strictly stronger than a one-line CI
step (issue #337 fix direction 4).

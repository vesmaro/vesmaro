"""Version guard (#204) — VERSION file and pyproject.toml must agree.

Catches version drift between the two release markers BEFORE it reaches a
tag or a PyPI upload. Fail-loud, no fallbacks.

Also guards the import pin (#288): the suite must import THIS checkout's
``mnemos``, not a shadow install (user-site editable / .venv / another
checkout). The conftest front-pin enforces it at collection time; the
test below re-asserts the invariant so any session that collects this
file (e.g. one bypassing conftest via ``--noconftest``) still fails loud.
